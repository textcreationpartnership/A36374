            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60846:3"/> both. And when ſuch exalted perſons are pleaſed to receive thoſe things, and approve by uſing them, this becomes an advantage to both: They have the ſervice of what is moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its kind; and their uſing it recommends it to others: For the inferiour ranks of Mankind commonly derive their Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of things from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices of thoſe that are above them. It is becauſe I account this Book very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in its kind, and worthy to be recommended as ſuch to the World, which makes me preſume, <hi>Madam,</hi> to dedicate it to ſo high a Perſon as your Honour. I hope, if you pleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:60846:3"/> to acquaint your ſelf with it, that I ſhall have the honour to be approv'd in my Judgment of it, and It may have the great advantage to be recommended by you. I know that your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht Mind is diſpoſed to approve of what is ingenious and devout. Here preſents it ſelf to your Honour, Divine Truth in a decent and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Attire; it were not fit for any one to make you a Viſit in a careleſs Undreſſe. The Beauty here is not conceal'd and diſguiſed by too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ornament, nor expos'd to Contempt by too little. This Book, you may be pleas'd to obſerve, is fitted to poſſeſs mens
<pb facs="tcp:60846:4"/> Minds with that pure and peaceable Wiſdom which is from above; to excite Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the coldeſt and moſt careleſs Hearts; and to poſſeſs with a love of Devotion our too nice and witty Age, ſince here it appears ſo rational and ingenious even in its higheſt flights.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60846:4"/> all ſuch Teſtimonies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Gratitude as I am able. Yet I moſt humbly crave your Pardon for this Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as what it were ſtill greater preſumption to expect without ſeeking it: And, doing thus, it were a very guilty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair on the other hand, if I ſhould not hope to obtain it from a goodneſs ſuch as yours. Your Honour cannot want any Noble Quality in an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree, who derive your high Birth from two Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families; and are furniſht in them with ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preſidents.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOme Account of the Following Book I am bound to give, in point of Juſtice both to it and my ſelf; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be ſaid tending to promote the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it. Which things will be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Preface; and in ſuch matter it will not be impertinent to detain the Reader for a little while.</p>
            <p>It was a Book of Devotions diſpos'd into the Form and Method of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary; and, though the matter of it was not the ſame with that, yet therein were the Truths of Chriſtian Religion frequently mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the Belief of that Church, with thoſe erroneous Doctrines which in latter Ages have been added to Chriſtianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What I thought to be ſuch by the direction of Holy Scripture, and the Articles of our Church which are drawn from thence, according to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſual Interpretation made of it by the
<pb facs="tcp:60846:7"/> moſt pure and primitive Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I have taken away, and connected the Sence with what thoſe Rules ſuggeſted to be truth. Therefore has this Book the Title of <hi>Reform'd Devotions.</hi> And I dare ſay, if Holy Scripture may be the Rule to judge by in theſe matters, (as it muſt be in all ſuch matters) the Book is now more truly corrected and amended, than it was in any of the former Editions, though it pretends to have been four times printed, and twice with that Advantage. In the fourth and laſt Edition, which is dated, <hi>Roan. 1685.</hi> it is ſaid to be corrected and augmented; and there is added to it in that a whole Office for the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> which being very different from the former Book, and much inferiour to it in all Reſpects, and more corrupted, I have wholly left it out; and having made uſe of that part of the former Book which provided for all the Saints Dayes, I ſhould have wanted a good Reaſon for ſo regarding one particular Saint, if I had uſed that part of the Book diſtinct: And there being enough of the other to ſerve my Method, I did not trouble my ſelf to pick out the beſt Sentences of that to mix with the reſt. This I did out of one Office in the other Book; becauſe in the preſent Method I had no occaſion for it diſtinct, and becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:60846:7"/> the greateſt part of that Office related to the Souls ſuppos'd to be in Purgatory.</p>
            <p>I am juſtified in the reforming of this Book, and purging out thoſe fore-mention'd Doctrines, by the Authority of our Nation, which did, for the ſake of them, a few years ago condemn the Book to a publick burning. And becauſe there was a great deal of it very good Sence, and that compos'd in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devout ſtrain, and an ingenious ſtyle, and mixt with ſeveral curious Hymns; I thought it was worthy of a Reformation, and as well too good to be thrown away whole, as too bad to be uſed whole: Which I doubt not, all ingenious and devout Readers will acknowledge upon peruſing what is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, when I ſhall have ſaid, that the moſt of it is but what I found in that Book. Yet I ſubſcribe to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of that Condemnation which it underwent as it was; for the better it was in ſome reſpects, (ſince many offenſive things were contained in it, and they often with great Artifice inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated in very diſguiſing terms) the more it did deſerve that fate. Some paſſages there were in it capable of two Interpretations, which joyn'd with falſe Doctrines, muſt be interpreted to an ill meaning; but joyn'd with Truths, muſt be underſtood to mean well: And ſome of thoſe do ſtill remain here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:60846:8"/> I was loth to throw out any thing needleſly; and eſpecially if there was Wit and Elegancy in the Compoſure; that ſo this Book might be in ſome reſpects better, and in others, at leaſt, no worſe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. There were in it <hi>Leſſons</hi> to every Office, which I have left out, becauſe they conſiſted of but ſome Sentences of the truly Canonical Scripture, joyn'd without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with other Sentences; and that Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which thoſe Scriptures were in, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that Authentick among us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I did not alwaies think them exactly ſuited to the places they held; and I think the abſence of them may be reckon'd well enough ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by the pertinent Sentences of holy Scripture which I have through the whole Book fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mixed with the matter of it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince thoſe that will read Leſſons in their private Devotions, have the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their hands, tranſlated into the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue. The <hi>Hymns</hi> that were in the former Book are all retain'd, and one is added to fill up the preſent Method: But they are many of them alter'd; ſome to be corrected, ſome to be ſupplyed with a few Syllables, or a Stanza here and there to fit them to the Tunes of our ſinging Pſalms, as many of them were before, and now they all are. The <hi>Petitions</hi> here are gather'd
<pb facs="tcp:60846:8"/> partly out of thoſe parts of the former Book, which in that were called Pſalms, in this Meditations; and partly from other places.</p>
            <p>The Devotions <hi>for every Day in the Week,</hi> are not ſo appropriated to thoſe Dayes of the Week they are deſign'd for, but that they may be uſed on any other day; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I know no reaſon for ſuch appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They are thus placed to diſpoſe them in ſome Method, that they might not lye together like a confus'd diſorderly heap. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe for the Lord's Day are moſt proper for that: Thoſe ſet to Thurſday, becauſe all the Subject of them is the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, are very fit to be uſed on any Day when we receive that holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. To this, that ſome of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſaid to be deſign'd for the <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,</hi> I ſay; Thoſe that will be pleas'd but to look beyond the Title, will be as well ſatisfied with the matter of that, as of any other part of the Book. I did not contrive the Book ſo diſtinguiſht, but found it ſo, and thought that Method might render it the more uſeful to thoſe who ſhall be willing to uſe it in a Method. Some among us are willing to obſerve ſuch Dayes according to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of our Church, and they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably on them make uſe of what is here allotted to thoſe Dayes, for their ſakes. Others
<pb facs="tcp:60846:9"/> perhaps are not fully ſatisfied in their minds to do this, and they may with good Profit (if they pleaſe) read that part of the Book on any other Dayes: And why then ſhould the latter ſort be diſpleaſed, if the former are gratified; and I, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rule and Practice of St. Paul, do become all things to all men for their good. To my Charity, he that regards a Day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards it to the Lord; and he that regards not a Day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. I ſuppoſe the different Practice may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in both from pious minds, (but ſuch as are poſſeſs'd in this matter with ſome difference of Opinions) and I will not judge or ſet at nought any of my Brethren: And as I am not willing to put the worſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation that can be upon the Practices of any, ſo I deſire all would deal thus with me, and where any thing in the Book may be interpreted to a good meaning, that they would do ſo. This Practice, I am ſure, is contain'd under that general and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule, of doing to others as we would they ſhould do unto us. I have aſſiſted the one ſort the more willingly, becauſe it will be no prejudice to the other; unleſs they pleaſe to reject what is not in it ſelf the leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, meerly for bearing ſuch a Title as this, and for being in ſuch a method as may
<pb facs="tcp:60846:9"/> render it the more uſeful to ſome of their Brethren. I deſire of the World but this piece of Juſtice alſo (which I ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain from all that are not ill-natur'd in the caſe) that every one do commend what they may like in the book; for then I am ſure it will be univerſally commended; and then it will be the more generally and the more profitably uſed, which is the end I aim'd at in ſeeking to approve it to many.</p>
            <p>In Reforming a book from ſuch principles as are purg'd out of this, it is well known I am not without ſeveral Preſidents. And what has been done of this kind before ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found good acceptance, both formerly and more lately, I was thereby the more encourag'd in this undertaking: I will not diſparage what others have done; but I think there may be obſerved ſome defects in their work; which I have avoided. The Book that I have choſen to correct, does equal, at leaſt, if not exceed any other that has been thus uſed. Indeed I have not ſeen that writing of any Authour of the ſame Communion, which in my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was comparable to this excellent piece: The matter of the book I preſume is not at all leſs fit to aſſiſt, and excite true and wiſe Devotion than it was before: For there is no need of errors to promote any
<pb facs="tcp:60846:10"/> exerciſe of true Religion: And there being ſo much of excellent and uſeful matter ſtill left, what is ſeparated may the better be ſpar'd. And the leaving out thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples renders the book more generally uſeful, ſince now it is become ſo to thoſe of our Church, while they will meet with nothing in it, but what they can aſſent to: And it may ſtill, if they pleaſe, be uſeful to thoſe of the other Communion, ſince the peculiar principles, which they have receiv'd are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left out, and the remaining matter is what all ſober Chriſtians may agree in: Indeed I intended not to infect it with controverſie, and not to gratifie but rather divert the contentious humour of the age. I would not engage the World more in controverſie, which perhaps is already too much engag'd in it; but had rather poſſeſs mens minds with an affectionate powerful ſenſe of thoſe important Truths, which Chriſtians do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſent to; and which are of abſolute neceſſity to be known, and lov'd, and obey'd; for which purpoſe this book is perhaps as well fitted now, as any that can be met with: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs any one will except that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble book the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of our <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm,</hi> lately compoſed for the uſe of the Dioceſs of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> I can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſent to him that ſhall preferr that to
<pb facs="tcp:60846:10"/> this: In this following book I am ſure no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and judicious Reader, cannot think that the devout and ſerious expreſſions do want their Foundation in Reaſon, by being ſeparated from the Principles that are purg'd out. Many ſuch Expreſſions may be found in the writings of the devout and elegant Fathers, which could not be drawn from ſuch Principles, becauſe they are of a later inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Beſides, the Holy Scripture and the fundamental Truths drawn from thence, and contain'd in the four firſt Creeds, are Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough for ſuch things. It were a miſtake therefore to imagine, that we muſt needs be beholden to any peculiar or diſtinct principles, not held by the truly ancient and Apoſtolick Church, for ſuch a production as this. I think it may appear by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing book, that thoſe principles are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as a Foundation, nor any wayes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of thoſe who ſhall be willing to uſe this Book in a certain Order and Method in their private Devotions, (where a good Method conſtantly obſerv'd is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) I ſhall ſuggeſt a few things for <hi>Direction in the Uſe of it.</hi> I ſuppoſe the ordinary Courſe of moſt Perſons in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſe, is onely to read, perhaps, the Holy Scripture, or ſome good Book, and to
<pb facs="tcp:60846:11"/> Pray: But I think thoſe that do only ſo, leave out one of the moſt profitable parts of the Exerciſe, which at leaſt thoſe Perſons that have, or might have leiſure, ſhould never omit, that is <hi>Meditation:</hi> To revolve, and over and over conſider, and reflect upon ſome divine Truths, that they may make impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their minds, and raiſe in them ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Affections: This tends to make the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the mind, and the courſe of a Mans life conformable to thoſe Truths, which is the end every man ſhould aim at in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions: None may account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more religious and good for ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much time in them, unleſs they have this influence and effect upon their hearts and lives, unleſs they practiſe the more of Religion in their Converſations. Now in the performance of this part of private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, it were doubtleſs beſt, if every one could raiſe ſuitable and affecting thoughts to be Meditated upon from the Scriptures he has read; which is according to the Advice of a late very prudent Author, who has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>A Method and Order for private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</hi> But I fear there are but few that can practiſe this way with any great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves, at leaſt till they have long practiſed it, and taken a great deal of pains to accuſtome themſelves to it, and
<pb facs="tcp:60846:11"/> ſo can perform it with eaſe and pleaſure; the difficulty therefore, and little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at firſt, do I doubt, keep many from a reſolute tryal of it. Inſtead therefore of that way of Meditating, and for ſuch as cannot uſe it, I think theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> fit to be uſed. Then, after that a perſon has Read his Chapters in the order which he has propoſed to himſelf, he may do well to read over the Meditations here provided for the day: But this he muſt do, ſo as that it may be properly a Meditating on theſe things, not a curſory reading of them: He ſhould proceed very deliberately, often look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, and reviewing a Sentence that is paſt, to ſee, if it did not affect him before, whether it may not do this upon the review; and to try if he may not find ſomewhat more of importance in it, than he apprehended at the firſt reading. After Meditation is done, then he is to proceed to <hi>Prayer,</hi> wherein he may have aſſiſtance from the <hi>Petitions</hi> here added; they are not a compleat Prayer of themſelves, nor were deſign'd to be ſo, but only to ſuggeſt ſome Requeſts fit to be put into our Prayers, ſuitable to the foregoing Meditations: Therefore there are not in them any ſuch Petitions or Acknowledgments as are proper for the Morning or the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any Petitions for the King, the
<pb facs="tcp:60846:12"/> Church, or our Friends, which ſhould never be omitted in our Prayers. Now they that uſe a Form which has thoſe other parts, may take in theſe where they think fit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſider'd and reſolv'd it before they begin, or elſe they may ſay theſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: They that do not uſe a Form in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, may add theſe to their Prayer by their Memory, or by having the Book before them: And if any perſon has been ſeriouſly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Meditations, he will be mightily diſpos'd to make ſuch Requeſts as theſe that follow them. As for the <hi>Hymns,</hi> it will be fitteſt, if any perſon will ſing them, either to begin his Exerciſe or end it with them, according as he finds himſelf inclin'd: To help thoſe that may not readily find out the Tunes which theſe may be ſung to, I think fit here to ſuggeſt this; thoſe that will goe to the more common tunes, are Hymn 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 28, 31, 39. Thoſe that will goe to the Tune of the Hundredth Pſalm, are Hymn 7, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33, 36, 38, 40. Thoſe that will goe to the Tune of the Hundred thirteenth Pſalm, are Hymn 10, 26, 29, 30, 35, 37. Thoſe that will goe to the Tune of the twenty fifth Pſalm, are Hymn 19, 22, 32, 34. If the time will allow a man, and devout affection inclines
<pb facs="tcp:60846:12"/> him to it, he may uſe at once <hi>Both Parts</hi> of the Devotions for the Morning or Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day, but by no means ſhould any man conſtrain himſelf to this, and therefore they were thus divided: For, according to the very prudent <hi>Advice</hi> that an excellent Guide in theſe matters gave <hi>to a Friend;</hi> 
               <q>We ſhould obſerve what we can do with eaſe and pleaſantneſs of ſpirit, and when we find our ſelves to be free and forward, then we may be the longer and the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd in our Devotions; but when we are heavy and ſtreightned, then it is not fit to tire our Spirits, and drag them along with us whither they have no ſtrength to accompany us, nor diſpoſition to comply with our deſires.</q> And the whole Book being thus divided, ſome may find it of uſe to them, to uſe ſometimes one part and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another, as being moſt affected with ſuch variety. I ſhall not need to direct par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on what dayes thoſe parts of the Book deſign'd for the Holy-dayes ſhould be uſed, for that will be ſufficiently ſuggeſted by the publick Liturgy of our Church, to thoſe that are acquainted with it; where alſo they will be directed to very appoſite, and fit portions of Scripture to be read up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Occaſions. And now I dare ſay, that the following Book is not onely better
<pb facs="tcp:60846:13"/> in the matter of it than it was before, but it is alſo better fitted in its method to aſſiſt our private Devotion.</p>
            <p>With hearty Prayers to Almighty God for its good ſucceſs, I ſend it forth into the World: May it abundantly promote his Honour, may it cauſe many to have ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and affectionate thoughts of Religious matters, may it promote a true and ardent Love to God in the World, which will be proportionably attended with Love fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Let all know, I conſtantly endeavour that it may be a ſmall thing to me to be judg'd by mans judgment, which is oft miſtaken both in approving and condemning: And there is one, even the great God, who will be the final Judge of us all, to whom I am chiefly concern'd to approve my ſelf: To him be Glory from us all, for ever and ever.</p>

Welcome to us, and our dark World; for the healing ſaving light thou bringeſt. May thy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant Name ſhine bright for ever. May all the Earth be enlightened with thy beams, and every frozen Heart diſſolve and ſing. May all the Generations to come entertain thee with reverence, and employ thee in the praiſe, and worſhip of the Lamb who is the Light of thee. This is the Day which our Lord has
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60846:15"/> made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein. This is the day that he has ſanctified to himſelf; and call'd by his own moſt holy Name. Hark, O my Soul, doſt thou not hear the King of Heaven invite thee into his preſence? He graciouſly bids thee to ſuſpend the mean Employments of this World; to lay aſide thy corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding earthly Cares: He calls thee to the honour of Communion with himſelf; to ſpend a day in his moſt delightful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; he deſires to entertain thee with unſpeakable Joyes in his Houſe of Prayer; to feaſt thee with ſpiritual Dainties, that afford ſtrength and pleaſure to the Mind. Worthy art thou, O Lord, of all our time; worthy to receive the Praiſes of all thy Creatures. Every moment of our life is bound to bleſs thee; ſince every moment ſubſiſts by thy Goodneſs. Shall others labour ſo much for Vanity, and ſhall we not reſt for the ſervice of our God? Shall we employ the whole week on our ſelves, and not offer in gratitude one Day to Thee? To <hi>thee</hi> who beſtoweſt on us all we have; and wilt give us hereafter more than we can now receive or hope for. A day ſpent in thy Courts, O Lord, I will prefer to a thouſand that engage me in any other places. I will go to the

It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves. Let us enter into his Gates with thankſgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe. Come let us adore our Glorified Saviour.</p>

O maintain I pray thee ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after thy ſelf, and fulfil them while I am waiting where thou appointeſt. Draw nigh to us who are drawing near to thee. Make us ſitly to perform our Duty. <hi>Open thou our Lips, and our Mouths ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> Open thou our eyes, O Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, that we may ſee the beauty of thy Commands; how Wiſe and Sweet in themſelves they are, how Neceſſary and Beneficial to us: While they improve our felicity here, and fit us for that which will be hereafter. Send forth thy beams of ſpreading light, O thou that art the morning Star! and lead us to thy Holy Hill. Send forth thy Truth, O increated Wiſdom! and bring us to thy Bleſſed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60846:18"/> Tabernacle. Guide thou our Lives, O Gracious Lord! in the waies of thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, that by obſerving faithfully thoſe excellent rules, we may all every where be happy. O Glorious Jeſu! in whom we live, and without whom we dye; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie in us by thy Spirit all ſenſual deſires, and quicken our Hearts with thy Holy Love; that we may no longer have a high eſteem for the Vanities of this world, but may place our affections entirely on thee. Show us thy glorious ſelf, O <hi>Jeſu;</hi> in thee we ſhall behold all we can wiſh. Only ſo much we beg to conceive of thy Majeſty as may move our Hearts to ſeek thee: Only ſo much diſcovery we ask as may conform us to thy likeneſs. If we may not know thee clearly now; let us know at leaſt ſo far as to make us long to know further. If we cannot perfectly love thee in this Life, let us love ſo much as that we may deſire to love more. So let us know and Love thee here, O thou the Soveraign bliſs of our Souls! that we may hereafter know thee better, and Love thee more for ever; to our Eternal Bliſs, and thy Eternal Glory thereby.</p>

                     <p>LEt them, O Lord, ſeek other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; who expect no felicity from thee. Let them fill up their time with other employments, and waſt the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Holy day, who think thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not worth their labour. As for me, my Souls chief content ſhall be to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the Glories prepar'd for thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants above. So will I meditate on them as often as the daies of ſacred leiſure do return, that my Heart ſhall be firmly ſet upon thoſe Glories. And all the few years that I live ſhall ſpend themſelves to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that one Eternal Sabbath which thy Saints ſhall celebrate in Heaven. A Day that is, whoſe brightneſs knows no night; nor ever fears the leaſt eclipſe. Whoſe chearful brow no cloud o're-caſts, nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60846:19"/> does any Storm ever moleſt the paſſage of its raies. But it ſtill ſhines on ſerene and clear, and fills with ſplendor all the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Palace. That ever-living day needs not the fading luſtre of our Sun; nor the borrow'd Silver of the Moon. The Sun that is riſen there is the Lamb, and the light that ſhines is the Glory of God. O how Beauteous Truths are ſaid of thee, thou City of the King of Heaven! Thy Walls are rais'd with precious ſtones, and every Gate is one Rich Pearl. Thy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are built with choiceſt Jewels; and the pavement of thy Streets is tranſparent Gold. Along in the midſt of thee runs a Chryſtal River, perpetually flowing from the Throne of God. There all along thoſe pleaſant banks, does moſt delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly grow the Tree of Life. A Tree which can heal all wounds with its balmy Leaves; and make immortal all thoſe who eat and taſte its pleaſant Fruit. Thus is the Holy City built; thus is the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> like a Bride, in every part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd. O Bleſt and Glorious City, how Free, how Rich, how Secure, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thy glad Inhabitants! Every Head in thee wears a Royal Crown, and every Hand a Palm of Victory. Every Eye
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60846:20"/> overflows with joy, and every Tongue with Pſalms of Praiſe. Behold, O my Soul, the Inheritance that we ſeek; and where can we find more Riches to invite us? Behold the felicities to which our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Saviour calls us; Conſider what Manſions he is gone to prepare; Where can we meet with ſuch pleaſures to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us? Can thy Sences preſent to thy Knowledge a place on Earth like this? Surely they cannot: Baniſh then, my Soul, all worldly vain deſires. Let none of them hereafter moleſt thy Peace. Look not at the tranſitory things which are ſeen, but at the Eternal which are not. And ſo receive ſome glimpſe of this Heaven, to encourage and quicken thy Travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60846:20"/> thou revealed thy ſublime rewards, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and captivate us with things that of this world are moſt admired. Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Crowns, thou know'ſt, are apt to win the Hearts of us thy Children. Children, alas! we are too truly in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Knowledge: O that we were ſuch in Love and Duty. My Soul, if theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſhadows of the future bliſs do tranſport and pleaſe ſo many men, ſhould not the real ſubſtance ſweetly delight thee? What is a drop of Water to the boundleſs Ocean; or a grain of duſt to this vaſt Globe? Such, O my God, and infinitely leſs are the richeſt Kingdoms here below; If we compare their moſt pompous State with the meaneſt degree that is in the Court of Heaven. When thou haſt fed us a little while with Milk; thou inviteſt our appetite to ſtronger Meat. Thou telleſt us of a ſweet delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life; in the bleſt Society of Saints and Angels: With whom we ſhall dwell in perpetual Friendſhip; and be lov'd and eſteem'd by them all for ever. Thou telleſt us of a pure Soul-raviſhing joy in beholding the amiable face of Jeſus. Whoſe Gracious ſmiles ſhine round about, and fill the Heavens with Holy Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60846:21"/> And thou telleſt, dear Lord, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that are ſtill incomparably higher than all theſe. Hearken well to ſuch things, O my Soul, and humbly adore thy bounteous God. His abundant goodneſs has provided thee large rewards indeed, he intends himſelf to be thy Portion and exceeding great reward. Himſelf he will clearly unveil before us, and openly ſhew us that great ſecret: What it is, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, to behold thy face, to know as we are known. O happy ſecret! if once at laſt attain'd; If once we can but ſee the face of our God in Glory. To know the Immenſity of thy ſelf-ſubſiſting Eſſence; and the Infinite Excellence of all thy At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. To know the power of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father; and the Wiſdom of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Son; and the Goodneſs of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; the incomprehenfible Glories of the undivided Trinity. This, O my Soul, is the top of Happineſs; this is the Supream perfection of our Nature. This, this alone is worthy to be the aim of our Being; the Hope and End of all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. When we are come to this we ſhall preſently reſt, and our ſatisfied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires will reach no farther. We ſhall be fill'd with overflowing bliſs, and our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

                     <p>NEver can we ſay too much, my Soul, of this glorious ſubject; never can we think enough of the Felicities of Heaven. Ariſe my Soul, and leave mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and time below thy flight; to thee theſe joyes belong: Ariſe and advance thy ſelf on high: Fly away with the wings of thy Spirit; are they not ſtrong enough to lift thee from earth? the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon of it is want of exerciſe. Fly if thou canſt poſſibly to that land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, try reſolutely, ſtrive manfully to do ſo; and viſit thoſe Heavenly Regions. Take an Evenings walk in that Paradiſe of pure delights, amongſt the beautified Spirits of juſt men who perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Eternal Deity. Think thô thy habitation at preſent is in this vale of tears, thou mai'ſt hope one day to be advanced to their dignity; to have a place and ſing among their holy Quires: We may hope to know all things that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60846:22"/> are produc'd, and to know beſides the all producing Cauſe. O what a fire of love will it kindle in our hearts, when we ſhall ſee thoſe ſhining Myſteries! When our great God, like a burning mirrour, ſhall ſtrike his brightneſs on the eyes of our Soul. O what exceſſive joy will that love produce! a love ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deſiring, and ſo fully ſatisfied? When our capacities ſhall be ſtretcht to the utmoſt, and the rich abounding Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhall fill and Overflow them: O what profound repoſe will that Joy beget! a Joy ſo exceeding high, and ſo eternally ſecure? When in amorous languiſhment we ſhall ſweetly diſſolve into a fort of bliſsfull Union with our firſt beginning: When without loſing what we are, we ſhall become even what he is: We ſhall take part in all his Joyes, and ſhare in the Glories of all his Heaven. O what divine and raviſhing words are theſe! How gently they enter and delight my Ear! How they diffuſe themſelves over all my Brain, and ſtrongly penetrate to my very Soul! Methinks they turn to ſubſtance as they go, and I feel them ſtir and work through all my powers: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they lie as a rich Cordial at my

There, O my Soul, we ſhall reſt from all our labours, which are but the way to all that happineſs: There we ſhall reſt from ſin and ſorrow, and no longer be troubled with our ſelves or others: There we ſhall reſt for ever in the protection of our God; in the arms and boſom of our deareſt Lord: We ſhall enjoy a reſt not ſenſeleſs and ſtupid as here, but attended with ſpritely joy and pleaſure: Such is the deſirable reſt that remains for the Servants of God.</p>

                     <p>IT is highly fit and juſt that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do adore their Maker. The great God form'd our bodies out of the Earth, and gave us the Spirit in man which bears his likeneſs; a Soul that all created nature cannot ſill, nor any thing that is below his own Immenſity: He has freely beſtowed on us all the reſt of his Creatures, which are fitted to ſerve and delight our bodies: But he has moreover deſign'd us for his glorious Kingdom, that we might dwell with him in perfect bliſs. All the Creatures he has made, the great God has alwayes under his obſerving eye ſo long as they continue in being: All things are open and naked to his Omniſcience. Though his Throne of State be eſtabliſht above, and the ſplendours of his glory ſhine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Bleſſed that are there; yet his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60846:25"/> unlimited Eye looks down to this lower World, and beholds all the wayes of the Children of <hi>Adam:</hi> If we go out he marks our ſteps, and when we retire; our ſhut Cloſet cannot exclude him; while we are alone he minds all the vain and roving imaginations that we have, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves too the end that we aim at in all the Studies which we apply our ſelves to: When we converſe with others, He obſerves our deportment, and the good or ill we do to them or our ſelves: In our Devotions he takes notice of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and regards with what attention and affection we make our Prayers. All the day long he conſiders how we ſpend our time, and the darkeſt night conceals not our works from him: If we deceive our Neighbour, He ſpies the fraud, and hears the leaſt whiſper of a ſlandering tongue: If we in ſecret oppreſs the Poor, or by private alms relieve their wants; If in our hearts we murmur at the Rich, or live contented with our little porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whate're we do, He perfectly ſees us; where e're we are He is ſure to be with us. He that made the Eye, ſhall not he ſee? and ſhall it be ſaid that he cannot hear who formed the Ear? But
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60846:25"/> O thou Sovereign Lord of Heaven, why doſt thou ſtoop thus low thy glorious Eye? What canſt thou find that here does deſerve thy view, among the trifles of this empty world? It is not thy own ſatisfaction that thou ſeekeſt herein, but thy deſign is our advantage. Thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt ſtill ready to puniſh our ſins, that the fear of thy rod may prevent our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Sure, O my God, thy favours muſt be ſweet, ſince even thy threatnings have ſo much mercy: And I muſt be worſe than blind if I venture to be wicked in the face of Heaven: Thou doſt alſo Lord graciouſly ſtand by us to ſee us work, that thine awful Eye may quicken our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; thou art ſtill at hand to relieve our wants. When all thy work, my Soul, is done in the ſight of him thou ſerveſt, this may juſtly encourage thee, this may make thee hope that the Labours and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of thy love ſhall not go unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>MY God, ſince Thou art never abſent from us, we will endeavour to be alwaies preſent with thee. Often will we go up to thy Throne above, and there contemplate and admire thy glory. We will often wait upon thee in thy houſe, and there adore and praiſe thy mercy. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where will we ſeek to meet thee; and every where delight to find Thee. My ſoul let it be thy endeavour to walk with God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60846:27"/> in all the parts of thy converſation, and take heed that thou walk humbly with thy God. Gracious God, we will ſpread all our wants before thee, and offer all our Petitions unto thee. Thou doſt willingly incline a favourable ear to the Prayers that come from an upright and fervent heart. Thou art a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek Thee. Our God loves to hear us treat of Heaven, as if we made it the main buſineſs of our lives to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All other things we muſt ask with ſubmiſſion to Him; ſince we do not know what of them is abſolutely good for our ſelves. But his Eternal Joys we may beg without reſtraint; we may urge and preſs for his aſſiſtance to gain them. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the thing we may wiſh for, if for any thing, without reſignation. We may pray for it with great fervency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and he will not account us too importunate. O wiſe and gracious Lord, whatſoever thou doſt, thy love intends it for the good of thy ſervents. If thou doſt ſometimes defer to grant our requeſts; it is only in charity to us, to make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them. It is that we may more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly feel our own poverty, and be more ſtrongly convinc't of our dependance on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60846:27"/> Thee: That we may practiſe our Hope, and exerciſe our Faith and Patience while we long expect; and may practiſe the higher gratitude, when we receive at laſt. It is that we may learn this ſure and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py skill, of working in our ſouls the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that we deſire; For thoſe very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by being often renew'd do at length themſelves become the Graces we ſeek. But O how improvident, Lord, are we! how unwilling to pray are the moſt of us alwaies, and all of us at ſome times! How does a ſhort ſervice ſeem long and tedious; and one half hour quite tire out our patience! We are ſlow to begin, and in haſt to make an end; We are heavy while the duty is a doing, and glad when it is done. Yet ſurely there is no eaſier work than to ask what we want, no purchaſe can be cheaper than to have for asking; for asking of him who is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear us, who will not upbraid, who will give kindly and not diſdainfully. There is no ſweeter pleaſure than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God; nor greater profit than to gain his favour. We have ſtill new tranſgreſſions to confeſs; and ſhall, alas, never want infirmities to lament. We have then great occaſion as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60846:28"/> often to wait upon God. And this work, my Soul, ought to be alwayes performed with a ſerious appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all thy powers to it. He is worthy of this whom thou ſerveſt, the important benefits thou mayeſt receive deſerve it. But unleſs we worſhip in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, we ſhall neither pleaſe him nor profit our ſelves. Take heed then that careleſs and vain thoughts do not contradict thy words when thou art at the exerciſes of thy devotion. Look to thy ſelf leſt when thou ſpeakeſt to Him, thou doſt not hear thy ſelf. And let no delay diſcourage thy Hope, nor the refuſal to grant any requeſt deſtroy thy conſidence in him. But let this firm foundation ſtill ſuſtain thee, and on this let thy peace be for ever eſtabliſht; that what is truly neceſſary his Goodneſs will not deny, and all the reſt it is thy duty to ſubmit to his pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>TAke heed, my ſoul, that thou do not ſo preſume on the divine bounty, as to omit the performance of thine own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Still to thy devotion ſee that thou add
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60846:28"/> thy beſt endeavours. If thou deſire God to relieve thy neceſſities, do thou alſo faithfuſly labour with thine own hands. Do not expect a Bleſſing to drop from the Clouds into hands that are onely held up, or that God will indulge thee in Idleneſs and neglect of thy ſelf. If we beg Grace for victory over our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; we muſt alſo conſtantly ſtrive to reſiſt their aſſaults. We muſt endeavour wiſely to foreſee particular dangers, and caſt about how to avoid them. We muſt uſe the proper weapons againſt every ſin that we would conquer. To every one oppoſe the ſtrict Command of the great God, the dire Threatnings againſt it, the Judgments executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners: The miſchiefs that are the natural Conſequents of ſin, the hurt it will do to the Body or the Soul of thy ſelf, the prejudice that it may do to the intereſts of thy Neighbour. Conſider, my Soul, it will be in vain to approach the holy God to worſhip him, unleſs thy life prepare the way for thy Offerings. Endeavour then to come with clean hands. Let thy Life be a continued Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Holineſs and Vertue, if thou wouldeſt obtain an Encreaſe of theſe by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60846:29"/> thy Prayers. Be thou merciful, if thou wouldeſt find mercy. God will ſhut his ears to thy loudeſt prayers; if thou do not open thine to the cry of the poor. He will deny to pardon thy treſpaſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, if thou doſt not forgive thine Enemies. But that very temper which diſpoſes us to be heard when we pray, does indeed depend upon his favour: Every condition that he requires on our part is nothing elſe but his own free gift. We ſhould then, my Soul, ask with all that we deſire, thoſe qualifications to which the things are promiſed. And as we find theſe increaſe in us, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope in the promiſes of God may alſo encreaſe. Let us ſtudy what he requires us to be, and aim at that in the firſt place, ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof, and then all other things that are neceſſary and good for us ſhall be added. Godlineſs entitles to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this life and of that to come. To the good man God will perform his promiſes in a bounteous meaſure. He holds his bleſſings as it were hovering over our heads, ſtill watching when we ſhall be ſit to receive them.</p>

Lord ſince thou art every where preſent, where e're I am thou art round about me, thou art in me and in all things: Communicate I pray thee to thy creature ſuch of thine exellencies as I want and am made capable to receive.

And when we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore thy gracious Mercy, what can we do but ſubmit our hopes, and expect the event from thy free goodneſs. If thou denyeſt what we wiſh, who can compell thy will; or call in queſtion thy Decrees?

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we confeſs, O Lord, in thee we live; in thee we move and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

And they that tell us our way, muſt be firſt taught it by thee. And they muſt be moved by thee to act
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60846:37"/> that Charity; and ſo at laſt all is reſolv'd into thee.

                     <p>THe Almighty Power of God ſuſtains our Life, and mercifully allows us ſpace to repent: that by well employing the time he lends us we may wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our own Eternity. Wiſely then thou acteſt, O my Soul, when thou ſetteſt apart ſome time every day wherein to meditate on God and his Word and works, by which thou maiſt be ſitted for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Eternity. Conſider then further the Divine Providence, and ſay within thy ſelf: Thus do we depend, O Lord! on thee, and happy we are in that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, did we but know our own true intereſt. We and our whole concerns are depoſited with God; and where can we find a better hand to enſure them? Is he not wiſe enough to chuſe ſafely for us, who diſpoſes all nature in ſuch admirable order? Has he not power to go through
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60846:38"/> with his purpoſe, who commands the will of men and Angels? Wants he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps an inclination to favour us, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires our felicity more than our own Hearts do? He feeds the Fowls of the Air, and cloaths the Lillies of the Field. Without his Providence not a Sparrow falls to the ground, and ſhall we miſtruſt his care for his Children? Under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we have liv'd all this while; and can we now ſuſpect hee'l forſake us? He has ſhown his bounty in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favours, and will he deny us his leſſer bleſſings? He has freely beſtow'd upon us his deareſt Son; how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things elſe? All that are uſeful to carry us on our way, and bring us at length to his Eternal Reſt. If our neceſſities be the effects of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we muſt not preſume that he will maintain us in our ſins: Rather we ſhould ſtrive to moderate our appetites and correct our vices that have bred theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. But if our wants be innocent and preſſing; he will ſooner do a miracle than break his word: This he has often ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engag'd; and often made good by his Providence. Ask but the former ages, and they will tell you the wonders
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60846:39"/> which he wrought in them in favour to his faithful Servants. He multiplied the Oyl in the Poor Widows cruſe; and fed his baniſht Prophet by a Raven. He dryed the Sea into a Path for his People, and melted the Rocks into ſtreams of Water to quench their thirſt. He made his Angels Stewards of their Proviſion, and nouriſht them in the Wilderneſs with the Bread of Heaven. Still, O my God, thy Eternal Charity retains the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for thoſe that rely on thee. Still thy all-ſeeing Wiſdom governs the World with the ſame immenſe unalterable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nay ſurely now the ſtreams of thy Mercy run more ſtrong; and have wrought to themſelves a larger channel. Since thou broughteſt down the Waters from above the Heavens; and openedſt in thine own Body a Spring of Life. A Spring of Joy and Bliſs to revive our Hearts; and overſlow them with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of everlaſting Pleaſures.</p>

                     <p>LEt us ſit down in Peace, O my Soul! and reſt ſecure in the boſom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Let us not diſturb the order of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60846:39"/> thoſe mercies which our God has deſign'd us in his eternal Councels: Every acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may be turn'd into vertue, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vertue is a ſtep towards our glorious end. If our affairs ſucceed, let us praiſe our great Benefactor, and think what he will give us hereafter, who does ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us here; if they miſcary, let us yield to the will of Heaven, and learn by our croſſes in this world to love the other: Whatever happens to us, this ought to be our conſtant rule, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the other life, and be contented with the preſent: Shall we not patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept a little evil from him that has given us much good? Shall the being without ſome one thing that we need not, more ſenſibly affect us than the having all that we need? Ingrateful wretches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common benefits that we all enjoy, deſerve the thankſgiving of a whole life; the air we breath in, the bright Sun that ſhines on us, the water and the bounteous earth that do ſo faithfully ſerve us; the exerciſe of our ſenſes, and the uſe of our wits, if not in excellency at leaſt to ſome degree: All theſe things, O Lord, thou generally affordeſt both to the good and to the bad; and for the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60846:40"/> leaſt of theſe none can praiſe thee enough. What ſhall we ſay then? can we yet with any juſtice complain becauſe ſome few perhaps are more proſperous than we? ſhould we not rather look down on the many below us, and be thankful to ſee our ſelves more favoured than they? ſhould we not do well, my Soul, to reckon over the ſeveral miſeries of mankind, and bleſs our God that has ſo farr preferr'd us? Had we ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Canker breeding on our face, or noiſom Leproſie ſpreading over our skin, (theſe we muſt all confeſs are incident to our nature, and much more than theſe is due to our ſins) what would we then give to be as we now are? how gladly would we exchange them for a moderate affliction? It is but to interpret our worſt condition well, and we ſhall ſind motives enow to excite our gratitude to God: It is but interpreting our beſt condition frowardly, and we ſhall imagine defects enow to make us think our ſelves miſerable. My Soul, do thou alwayes adore the wiſdom of God, and leave it to him as he pleaſes to rule his own world: All his works ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly praiſe him, and his Saints ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60846:40"/> bleſs him. He ſcatters theſe temporal things with a ſeeming negligence, as trifles of ſo little importance, that they ſignifie not either love or hatred. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heaven is indeed conſiderable, nothing but Eternity deſerves our eſteem: But if we could underſtand the ſecret character of the divine Decrees, we ſhould read in each ſyllable a perfect Harmony.</p>

                     <p>WIth awfull reverance, my Soul, conſider that the Great God is infinite in his power to puniſh, he has been and he can always be very terrible in his Judgments; Our God is a conſuming fire. Let vain duſt no more ſpeak proudly againſt the Almighty, nor be ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy as to provoke the living God. Let all ſeal up their lips in humble ſilence when they are witneſſes of his terrible Judgments, and with fear and trembling always remember them. Remember thou my Soul, how the Earth opened it ſelf and ſwallow'd up alive many thouſands of his Enemies. Call to mind that the Clouds rain'd Fire and Brimſtone and buried ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rebellious Cities in their own Aſhes. Remember that a general deluge did once by Gods Commiſſion over-ſpread the whole world, and ſwept away almoſt all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60846:42"/> mankind, when the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the Earth. Remember ſteadily that ſin was the cauſe of all this miſery and ruin. Sin threw the Angels down from Heaven; and chain'd them up in eternal darkneſs. Sin baniſht <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; and turn'd the delicious Garden into a Field of weeds. O God how terrible is thy mighty arm; when thou ſtretcheſt it forth to be avenged on thine enimies! O Sin how fatal is thy deſperate Malice; that pulls on our heads all the thunder of Heaven! O my Soul, how dull and ſenceleſſe are we, to ſleep ſecure as if all were ſafe! Can we repeat theſe amazing truths; and not tremble at the wrath of divine Juſtice? Can we conſider the deplorable end of Sinners, and ſtill dare to go on in the waies of Sin? Even when we ſing thy praiſes, O glorious Lord, it is our duty to rejoyce with trembling before Thee. What ſhould corrupted nature then do, when it ſees it ſelf ready to offend Thee? What ſhould a guilty Conſcience do when it ſees it ſelf upon the brink of ruin by offending Thee?</p>

                     <p>YEt, O my Soul, do not give up thy ſelf to deſpair under a ſence of thy ſins; bring thou to him but a humble and penitent heart, and thou ſhalt find there is forgiveneſs with him. He that is thus infinte in power to puniſh, is full as infinite in goodneſs to ſave. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we broke his Commands, yet ſtill his Earth ſuſtains, and ſerves us. How oft, alas! have we abuſed our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Bread, yet ſtill his Clouds ſhower plenty upon us! He is merciful and gracious as well as Long-ſuffering; a God forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin; He ſpares us ſo long that we may have time to repent; and to ſeek and obtain his Pardon. Only the proud apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels find no forgiveneſs, becauſe their obſtinacy does refuſe to ſeek it. Could thoſe rebel ſpirits diſclaim their crimes, and turn again to obey their Maker, his clemency would ſoon revoke their ſentence, and reſtore them to ſhine in their firſt bright ſeats. But O the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of mercy vouchſafe't to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to us duſt and aſhes his contemptible
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60846:43"/> Poſterity! For whom the ſoveraign King of Heaven humbled himſelf to deſcend upon Earth, to lead a poor laborious life, and to ſuffer a painful death. He came to be a Prince and a Saviour to us, to give us repentance and remiſſion of ſins; to teach us by an exemplary Life how to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably to God; and to ſatisfie for our ſins by his death. Thy mercies, O Lord, are above all thy works; and this is above all the reſt of thy mercies.</p>

                     <p>STill, my Soul, dwell in contemplation of the divine mercies, it is good and pleaſant to be here. When we lay bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the abyſs of nothing, it was his own free Goodneſs that call'd us into being. He faſhion'd our limbs in our Mothers womb; and fill'd our Nurſes breaſts with milk. He enlarg'd our little ſteps when we began to go, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerv'd our helpleſſe Infancy. He commanded even his Angels to bear us up, leſt we ſhould daſh our feet againſt a ſtone. How many dangers, my Soul, conſider, haſt thou eſcaped, and not one of them but was govern'd by a Divine
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60846:44"/> Providence! How many bleſſings doſt thou daily receive, and there is not one of them which does not proceed from his bounty! He provided Tutors to inſtruct our Youth; and to plant in our tender minds the ſeeds of Vertue. He appointed Paſtors to feed our Souls, and ſafely guide them in the wayes of Bliſs. He ſeal'd his Love with Sacraments of Grace; to nouriſh in us Faith and Charity. All this thou haſt done, O merciful Lord! the wiſe diſpoſer of Heaven and earth. All this thou haſt done, and ſtill thou goeſt on by infinite waies to gain us to thy Love. Thou commandeſt us to ask, and promiſeſt to grant; thou inviteſt us to ſeek, and aſſureſt that we ſhall find. Thou doſt vouchſafe even thy ſelf to ſtand at the door and knock; and if we open thou entereſt, and filleſt our hearts with joy. If we forget thee, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweſt our Memories; if we fly from thee, thou ſtill kindly findeſt ſome means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call us. If we defer our amendment, thou doſt patiently ſtay for us; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs when we return we find thy arms open to embrace us. And if when we were not, thou didſt freely love us, we may be aſſur'd thou wilt not forſake
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60846:44"/> us when we ſtrive to love Thee. If when we had loſt our way and were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from thee, thy matchleſs kindneſs did condeſcend to ſeek us, and give us an effectual call, thou wilt not refuſe us when we ſeek after Thee.</p>

                        <p>I Therefore do moſt humbly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeek after thee my God. For all good I fly to Thee the Father of Lights, and giver of every good and perfect gift. And at this time, Lord, I ask of Thee that thou would'ſt alwaies poſſeſs my heart with an awful reverence of thy great Name. Chaſe away all levity and carleſneſs of ſpirit from me, by putting thy fear into my inward parts. Humble my too proud and wilful ſpirit to a ready ſubmiſſion to thy will in all things. Make me I pray Thee ſo to ſtand in aw of thee and of thy Judgments, that I may not dare to ſin. Thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thou haſt often executed on ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent ſinners, let them be often call'd to my mind; let the thoughts of them meet and antidote the temptations to ſin: Make my fear of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60846:45"/> them prevent my feeling the like. Still O Lord, let a lively ſenſible Conſcience cry out aloud when I am tempted, and ſay; Dare you commit this evil, and ſin againſt God? Dare you commit this evil and run upon the fire of divine Vengeance? Are you not afraid to provoke his wrath to plunge you into everlaſting torments? By thy Judgments in the world, thou O Lord expecteſt that the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be moved to learn righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Grant Lord that I may alwaies do ſo, that ſo thy Judgments on others may prove mercies to me. And let alſo thy abundant goodneſs and mercy ſhown to the penitent and faithful, win me to repent and truſt in Thee the merciful and Gracious God. Thus prevent me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Thee from being overawed by the terrors of the Lord. Suffer not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of my Soul to drive me into deſpair becauſe I am a Sinner, diſpoſe me to lay hold of the mercy offer'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, make me to believe and find that humble and penitent Sinners have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, the righteous Jeſus, the Chriſt; That he, who ſuffer'd on Earth for our ſins, is gone to Heaven to make interceſſion, and to plead that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60846:45"/> ſatisfaction in the behalf of thoſe that apply themſelves to him for his help. Incourage me to a ſteady practice, and further purſuit of Holineſs by the favours thou haſt ſhown to good men, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that I ſhall be aſſiſted therein, and that thou wilt hereafter, if not in this life, abundantly reward it. Thus Lord, let it pleaſe thee by my hopes and fears, which are the great ſwayers of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here, to counterpoiſe my propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity downwards to this earth, to keep me in a conſtant tendency upwards; lift me out of the dirt of this world, into a happy converſe with thee all my dayes.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60846:47"/> that ſeem ſmooth at firſt, but lead to danger, and end in ruine: Why do you boaſt your pleaſant life, who lye aſleep in the arms of Death? Awake, poor Souls, and ſhake off the golden dreams, that delude your crazy heads with empty fancies: Awake, and fill your eyes with penitent tears, ſadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the real miſeries to which your ſins have expoſed you: Conſider whither, alas, will your Souls be hurry'd, when in cold deſpair you ſigh away your laſt faint breath? they ſhall fly amaz'd from the ſight of Heaven, and hide their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſelves in eternal darkneſs; there they ſhall dwell with intolerable pains, wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting for ever; their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſhall ſit as in a deep dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and think on nothing but its own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; their will ſhall be heightned to a madneſs of deſire, and perpetually wrackt with deſpair of obtaining; their memory ſhall ſerve but to renew their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and their whole Souls be drown'd in a Sea of bitterneſs; there every vice ſhall have its proper torment prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bred out of its own corruption: The Laſcivious ſhall burn with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſires, perpetually flaming in the rage
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60846:48"/> of their own luſts; the Glutton and Drunkard ſhall vainly ſigh for a drop of water to cool their tongues; the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cholerick ſhall rage like mad Dogs, to their own only vexation; the ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Envious ſhall have thoughts that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gnaw and torment their own minds; the deſires of the Covetous ſhall be as thorns in a mans ſides; the haughty Proud ſhall be thrown down to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contempt, ſhall be loaded with utter diſdain; the Slothful ſhall miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore their loſt time, and languiſh with grief for their ſtupid negligence: But O what horrid pangs ſhall ſeize them all, and wound and pierce the very center of their Souls! anguiſh and trouble ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the whole ſpirit, when they ſhall ſee themſelves deprived of the bright and bliſsful Viſion of God! when their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God ſhall deſpiſe and reject them, as if they were not his creatures, ſhall caſt them away as offenſive to his ſight, and he that made them will not ſave them, will ſhew them no mercy: When they ſhall ſee themſelves eternally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht from the ſweet and gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Jeſus; that he will not be their Saviour, becauſe they would not take
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60846:48"/> him for their King: When they ſhall ſee that God who made them to enjoy his glory, will now caſt them into thick deep ſhades of eternal darkneſs; and the bleſſed Jeſus who came into the world to redeem ſinners, will ſay to them, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, I know you not: Then ſhall they curſe the day of their birth, and the unfortunate companions that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled them to ſin; they ſhall curſe this vain deceitful world, that draws them on in the wayes of perdition, and by a fatal miſt caſt before their eyes, hinders them from foreſeeing the perdition they are going to. Are theſe, alas! they will ſay, the effects of thoſe fond deſires, whoſe gratifications we made our chief felicity? Alas! what do now our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton liberties avail us? what the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pleaſures that we ſo eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? What comfort receive we from thoſe empty honours, from thoſe faithleſs rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that tempted us to ſin? they are all of them vaniſht away like a ſhadow, and gone as a cloud of ſmoak that is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the wind: But the remorſe and puniſhment of theſe endure for ever, and torture our ſpirits with perpetual anguiſh. Thus ſhall they cry and none
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60846:49"/> will regard them, thus mourn and there will be none found to pity: Such will be the diſmal end and conſequence of a ſinful and impenitent Life. Be thankful to God, O my Soul, whoſe gracious Providence has given thee warning to avoid theſe miſeries.</p>

                     <p>AS the day will come wherein God will deſtroy all the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; ſo the day will come, my ſoul, the day will certainly come, when the gracious God will reward and crown all that love his commandments, and ſeek the Glory he has made us for. Why do you mourn, ye children of the light; to whom belong the promiſes of Bliſs? you who feed on the pleaſant Fruits of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60846:50"/> Piety, and the continual feaſt of a good Conſcience? Who taſte already the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hope; and hereafter ſhall be ſatisfied with the fulneſs of Fruition. What can moleſt your happy ſtate; whom the God of glory has choſen for himſelf? whom He has adopted into his honourable family; and deſign'd for heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven. That Bleſſed Kingdome where all Delights abound, and ſorrow and tears are baniſht away: Where none are ſick, or grow old, or dye; where all flouriſh in perfect health, and live an immortal Life, in all the beauty and vigour of an Eternal Youth: Where none are perplext with cares or fears, but all dwell ſecure, and free for ever: Where we ſhall no more be ſubject to chance; no more be expos'd to the danger of temptation. No more ſhall we be croſs'd by others; nor ever diſquieted with our own Paſſions. There a ſerene tranquility ſhall alwaies dwell within us, and innumerable Joyes be round about us. Joy in the Excellencies of our glorified Bodies; joy in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our enlarged Souls. Joy in the ſweet ſociety of Saints; joy in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious company of Angels. Joy in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60846:50"/> ſight of our beloved Jeſus; joy in the bliſsful Union with the adorable Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All ſhall be joy and love and peace, and all endure for eternal ages. Let then the ſervants of our Lord rejoyce and ſing: ſweet is the yoke of thy Love, dear Lord, and light is the burthen of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: But O how far more rich are thy faithful Promiſes! how infinitely greater thy glorious rewards! When every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vertue in us ſhall there be rewarded with its proper Crown and Glory. The humble there ſhall be highly exalted; and the poor in ſpirit ſhall be prefer'd to be Kings. The meek ſhall poſſeſs that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land; and the Mourners be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with eternal refreſhments: The clean of Heart ſhall ſee the God of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the lovers of Peace ſhall have the priviledge of his Children: They who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs ſhall be filled, and the merciful will be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with the kind embraces of mercy: They who ſuffer perſecution for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake, ſhall receive a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they that are Teachers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten others, ſhall ſhine bright as the Stars: They who relinquiſh any thing for God, ſhall receive an hundred-ſold; and all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60846:51"/> the Juſt ſhall be in glory for ever. Then ſhall they bleſs the true Friend that at any time reproved their fooliſh courſes, and ſo was inſtrumental to convert them to the waies of Bliſs; they ſhall bleſs each cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable hand that was aſſiſtant to their happineſs. They ſhall praiſe and admire the provident mercies of their God; and ſing aloud the victories of his grace. With joyful wonder they ſhall ſay, Is this the effect of thoſe little pains we took; are theſe the Repairs for the petty loſſes we ſuffer'd? Happy we who deny'd our ſelves a few Toyes; and are now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to theſe high felicities. Millions of years ſhall paſs away, and our Glory ſhall but then ſeem to begin. Yea when millions of millions are paſt, our glory ſhall not for all that be nearer to its end. Thus ſhall they all rejoyce and none ſhall diſturb them, and all the Hoſts of Angels ſhall joyn with them in the high praiſes of God. O be very thankful, my Soul, to the Gracious God, whoſe favourable Providence to thee has brought this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to thy knowledge, that it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure thee to the purſuit of it.</p>

                     <p>AND now, my Soul, conſider what thou haſt to do. Conſider what it is likely to profit thee to gain the whole World and loſe thy ſelf. See Life and Death here ſet before thee, the rewards of Saints, and the pains of Sinners. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, and make thy eternal hearty choice; chooſe wiſely, and thou ſhalt not need to chooſe again. Chooſe while thy gracious Lord allows thee time and day, leſt the night of darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thy neglect. Make a Choice, but remember that all Eternity is concern'd; and conſider well, thou haſt reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſettle in reſolution. Call all the Pleaſures of the world before Thee; and ask if any of thoſe tranſitory reliſhes are worthy our enduring for them ſuch exceeding great, and endleſs pains. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether to ſatisfie ſome irregular paſſion, can recompenſe with equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the forfeiture of ſuch Felicities. Ask if the vain forbidden things thou loveſt, deſerve thy affection better than thy Maker. Are they more worthy in themſelves, or more beneficial to Thee,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60846:52"/> that thou maieſt juſtly prefer them before thy Redeemer? Doſt thou expect to be at reſt and ſatisfied by enjoying them? or everlaſtingly happy by their procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Will they protect thee at the hour of thy death, or plead thy cauſe at the day of Judgment? O no, they have little in them, they do but deceive me with a ſmiling look; which I have too often prov'd by dear experience. 'Tis Heaven alone that can yield a true content; it is that alone that fills with eternal delight. Say then my Soul, Take away your flatteries, falſe World; leave me a mind free for the entertainment of better things. If my Saviour turn but his Face towards me, my Mind ſhall be fixt on him. I will look continually on his glorious beauties; and be raviſht for ever with the charms of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis Thee, chaſte Spouſe of Souls, 'tis Thee alone I chooſe, and dedicate my ſelf entirely to thy ſervice. Say theſe things, and mean as thou ſpeakeſt, be thou hearty and ſincere in chooſing thus. Did we clearly ſee what we ſay we believe, it would make the moſt of men alter the vain courſe of their Lives. Did we but ſee the Damned in their

How ſhould we ſtrive againſt the next temptation; and caſt about to avoid the danger!

How ſhould we ſeek all occaſions of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and make it our buſineſs to work out our Salvation! What ſhould we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count too much to be done for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe matchleſs joyes! What ſhould we not readily do to avoid thoſe ſorrows! Yet all this is as ſure as if we ſaw it, and would move us as much if we could but ſeriouſly conſider it.</p>

                        <p>DEar Lord, it is only thou that canſt make me conſider theſe things ſo carefully as to reſolve upon a wiſe choice. If left to my ſelf, I am, alas! very likely
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60846:53"/> to chooſe the vain goods of this world, to neglect my Soul, to forfeit thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joyes, and to incurre thy eternal puniſhments. O Bleſſed Jeſu, do thou chooſe me, and make my ignorant Soul ſo ſenſible of my true intereſt as to chooſe Thee for my portion and Inheritance for ever. Make me chooſe to love Thee above all thy competitors here, and till I come to ſee thee; and then I am ſure that from thenceforth I cannot chooſe but love thee for ever.

                     <p>A Good Conſcience is a contiual feaſt; and a peaceful mind the Antipaſt of Heaven. Lord how ſecure and quiet they live, whom thy Grace preſerves in Innocence! The day goes ſmoothly over their heads, and ſilent as the ſhadow of a Dial. The ſpirits of their Fancy run calm and even; they ebb and flow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the allegiance which they owe to reaſon. All their delight is to think of Heaven; and to reckon over the many
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60846:54"/> taſtful joyes which they ſhall one day poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. The devout mind free from ſtormy paſſions is like a bright day of the Spring, wherein the beauty of the Sun has no cloud to obſcure it, the ſweet Air has no ſtorms to ruffle it, the glad Birds ſing, and all Nature puts on a pleaſing look. Such a mind is full of light and peace and joy, and puts the countenance into a ſedate and chearful compoſure. Oh the happineſs of ſuch a ſtate! Oh how deſirable is its eternal continuance! But our Days on earth are mixt with Nights, our calms with ſtorms, and fair weather with foul. Some unruly paſſion preſſes to come in, it is importunate, and fawns at firſt to gain admittance: It promiſes not to interrupt the Joy and Happineſs, but after a little time diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its pernicious intent if it be not very quickly rejected: Soon it grows bold to undermine our repoſe, and open a door to all our enemies. Juſt ſo at a little breach in the wall of a beleaguered City, a whole Army pours in their numerous body; and they enſlave all that ſubmit to their violence, and deſtroy all thoſe that make head againſt it. Such, alas! is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and hurt when once we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60846:54"/> yeilded to the firſt Aſſault of any Paſſion. Immediately a throng of tumultuating ſpirits croud into our heads, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſume the little remainder of our peace. O the endleſs diſtraction of a life led by humour, by blind will! O the miſerable thraldom of being ſubject to our paſſions: What a boiſterous ſea, every where beſet with Rocks and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, is to a Mariner; that is a Mind ſubject to violent paſſions, ſuch a mind is in continual danger of making Shipwrack of a good Conſcience. How often do our paſſions engage us to contend with others, and imbitter all our daies with ſtrife and envy! How often do they quarrel even among themſelves, and raiſe a fierce war in our own boſoms! If they by chance agree in one deſire, they many times vex us with their being diſappointed. And the vexation of diſappointment is ſo much the greater by how much they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. If they perhaps ſometimes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, they ſeldom produce the expected content. If they delight our corrupted taſte, and we greedily ſwallow their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome ſweets; then, alas, it is that they moſt undoe us, by feeding the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of our fatal diſeaſe. Vain at the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60846:55"/> beſt, and very ſhort of duration are the enjoyments of this world; and after they have flatter'd us a while, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray our neglected Souls into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin. Thou art, O Lord, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Anchor of our hope: O Jeſu, unleſs thou ſave us, we periſh.</p>

                     <p>THus are they miſerably toſt up and down, who float on the waves of their own Paſſions: Their wearied Souls ſoon faint within them, when they ſee the Lord has withdrawn his preſence: They ſeek him, but in ſuch diſtraction and confuſion that they cannot find him; they call upon him, but he gives them no anſwer preſently: And now, when all their fears are grown to the height, and no means appear to ſuſtain their patience; when the proud waves beat violently againſt them, and are ready to cover their little Veſſel with deſpair and ruin; then he awakes to their help, if they have perſiſted to call upon him; though he ſometimes may ſlumber for a while, to try their duty, or puniſh their diſobedience: Though he may ſuffer for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60846:55"/> a while the fury of the tempeſt to lye upon them, to ſhow them their hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtate if left to themſelves; yet when they ſtill ſeek and implore his help, his mercy at length hears their cry, and pities their fear and danger: And then his bleſſed voice commands a Calm, and immediately the Sea and ſtormy winds obey him; immediately his Sun ariſes in their hearts, and with its gentle beams revives their hopes: Then is their darkneſs turn'd into light, and the clouds diſperſt into a bright day: Then they recollect their ſcattered thoughts, and range them again in their right order. Often they look back on the dangers they have eſcaped, and as often bleſs the mercy that delivered them: Often they look forwards on the courſe they hold, and as often ſing with joy for their happy change: Welcome again, they ſay, the eaſie yoke of Chriſt, and the light burthen of loving our Saviour: Welcome the holy exerciſes of ſweet Devotion, welcome the eaſie, pleaſant, moderate heat of Soul-enflaming Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now we diſcern this beauteous truth, (O may we print it deeply in our minds) That the pleaſures of Piety
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60846:56"/> and Vertue are pure and conſtant, and that infinite bleſſings attend to reward it: But the purſuit of Vice is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and intricate, and finiſhes its courſe in an abyſs of miſery.</p>

If paſſions do ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade thee, let them not reſt in thy mind, do not give way to their ſettlement, leſt they grow into rooted habitual vices.

And remember alwaies when his Kindneſs has given thee ſeaſonable relief, that thou take care not to loſe this unhappy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; but learn wiſdom from thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60846:56"/> miſcarriage. Reflect and find out where thy Errour was; what betray'd thee into this diſorder, and fortifie thy ſelf againſt that defect. Carefully avoid all the occaſions of ſin; and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſuch as delight in folly: Avoid the ſnares of kind enticing Company, and the dangerous infection of evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Set a ſtrict watch continually upon thine Eyes, and diligently keep the door of thy Lips. Govern all thy Sences that they do not ſeduce the mind; and obſerve and govern every inward motion of thy Heart and Fancy. When, O my Soul, did we ever follow our Paſſions, but they inſtantly wrought our diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and did threaten our ruin. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs then all temptations in their firſt approach; when their power is weak, and thy choice is in full liberty. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how formerly their flatteries have abus'd thee; and when they counterfeit again, be no more deceiv'd. Never look on the face of Pleaſures as they come, but as they go off; when they leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind them but their venomous ſting.

                     <p>THe good and wiſe Creator of the world, made man at firſt after his own ſimilitude: He form'd a noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within him, and endow'd it with righteouſneſs, and true holineſs: He gave him dominion over the creatures, with which he would plentifully ſtock the Air, Earth, and Sea: He gave to man a perfect dominion over himſelf, and made him able to govern his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions: He made him ſole Lord of a beauteous Paradiſe which Gods own hand had planted. Man was to have ſpent a few pleaſant years on Earth, and then to have been tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Heaven of Heavens: But all theſe priviledges did the fooliſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture looſe, by doing one guilty and needleſs act; by eating of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60846:59"/> diſobeying the Law of his juſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Unhappy man has now forfeited all good, and expoſed himſelf to the invaſion of every miſery: By this one ſinful act, according to the tenour of the Covenant, our firſt Parents ruin'd themſelves, and all their poſterity with them: From thenceforth our bodies were doom'd to diſſolution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to return to the duſt from whence they were taken: From thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth brutiſh and ſenſual appetites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came rebellious againſt the laws of right reaſon; and the underſtanding is ſo blinded with partiality to ſence, that it is not able to find out thoſe Laws. The mind of man is deſtitute of its moral excellency, and the glorious Image of God is defac'd. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſpirit that tempted to the ſin, has infected our nature with his own reſemblance. Thus are we wretches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liable to all thoſe ſickneſſes and pains that infeſt our bodies; and thus to thoſe violent Paſſions and diſorders which diſtemper and torment our minds: By this ſin the favour of our God was forfeited, and we are all by nature the children of his wrath: We are expoſed to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60846:60"/> the tyranny of the Devils while we live, and lyable to partake in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when we dye. But when our great guilt had provok'd the divine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt us, our great miſery at the ſame time moved his compaſſion: He pityed the poor creature undone by its own folly, and reſolved to find help for it by his Wiſdom: His infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs pityed the many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Souls, which one raſh act of the firſt Parents had undone; and when they might expect to hear from his Juſtice an irreverſible ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, then did his wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy condeſcend to comfort them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firſt promiſe of a mighty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: A Saviour that ſhould conquer him who now had the power of death, and who is become ruler in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience. For thou, O ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Son of God, Son coeternal and equal with the Father: Thou didſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to redeem us by an amazing way, which will be the eternal won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all thy moſt inteligent creatures. Bleſſed Son of God, thou didſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our help when it was not in the power of any creature to help us: Thou
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60846:60"/> didſt undertake to ranſom us from our miſery, while the fallen Angels were left ſubject to theirs. In the fulneſs of time, O kind Redeemer, thou didſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that promiſe deſcend into this miſerable world: And, while here, thou wenteſt about doing good, and diffuſing the light of thy ſaving inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: By taking the humane nature into a perſonal union, thou didſt put thy ſelf into ſubjection under the law; and by thy ſpotleſs life and patient death thou haſt ſatisfied all the demands of the Law for us; ſo that believing in Thee we are righteous by thy life, and our ſins are attoned for by thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death: Thy death upon the croſs was our great ſacrifice for ſin, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient at once offering of thy ſelf to take it away. Thou haſt by thy meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious life purchaſed for us all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited good; and by thy propitiatory death removed our deſert of evil: By that death thou didſt go again out of this world, and art now aſcended to the right hand of the Father; there thou ever liveſt to make interceſſion for us, and to diſpence the purchaſes of thy life and death.</p>

                     <p>LOrd, what a happy change has thy coming made in the world! what glorious effects have every where been the conſequents of it! Narrow was once the gate, and ſtrait the path to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60846:62"/> bliſs, and ſo cover'd with the miſts of Ignorance, that but few could find it: The whole earth then corrupted their way before God, and wickedneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as faſt as people multiplyed: Then did but eight perſons among a great many thouſands find favour with God to be ſaved from an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge: In ſeveral populous Cities before this floud could well be forgotten, there could not ten righteous perſons be found, for whoſe ſake they might be ſpar'd from deſtruction: Then the rayes of divine light were communicated but to a few particular perſons: Only <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> found favour with God to have a numerous ſeed, and that his ſeed ſhould be heirs of a Covenant of Promiſe; I will be thy God, ſaid the Almighty to him, and the God of thy ſeed after thee: Accordingly he that was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> took alſo particular care of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and he gave his Statutes and Judgments to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but did not deal ſo with any other Nation: But ſince thy coming, O glorious Meſſiah, light is come into the world, and the way of Salvation has been made known to all men; uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60846:62"/> light has come wlth thee, no more oppreſt with ceremonial veils; which therefore has diffuſed it ſelf into the dark corners of the Earth, and ſpread it ſelf to the ends of the World. The Day-ſpring from on high has viſited our diſtant region, and on us has the Sun of righteouſneſs kindly aroſe. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, thanks be to thy Love, Dear Lord, has included within its pale a great many Nations; It has had thouſands that with a ſtrong and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous love have run ſwiftly after Thee in the way of thy counſels; nay, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions with a fair degree of hope, have walked conſtantly towards thee in the way of thy Commands. Whence, O my God, could this ſtrange improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come, but from the infinite Merits of the Redeemers death: Hence it was that when he had ended his holy Life, he aſcended to Heaven, and gave gifts to men; He gave largely of his Spirit to his choſen Apoſtles, and ſent them out to preach his Word, and diſpence his appointed Sacraments: He gave them the gift of Tongues, that they might Preach to all Nations; and the gift of working Miracles, to confirm
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60846:63"/> their Doctrines: By his Spirits coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with theſe, and ſucceeding their endeavours, they every where propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Faith and Love of Jeſus. Our kind Lord, before he aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, appointed the uſe of two ſacred Rites in his Church; to aſſiſt the Faith of thoſe who did not ſee his Perſon, that they might notwithſtanding believe, and in believing be bleſſed. Leſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould be ſo ungrateful as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, he has left us memorials of his tender love: By theſe he ſhews us his bloody Death and Paſſion, and makes himſelf preſent to thoſe that believe and love; and theſe by the powerful working of his Holy Spirit, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd many Diſciples in their moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith: Many they have poſſeſt with a holy fervour and courage, to do and ſuffer great things for the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. O bleſt Memorials of my Saviours love, and faithful ſeals of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes! whereby what he has done for us is repreſented, and what he has purchas'd is applyed to us: If I forget to ſing of you, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I forget to meditate on you, let my head forfeit its power to think.</p>

                     <p>WHere, O thou boundleſs Ocean of Immenſe charity! where will thy overſlowing ſtreams ſtay their courſe? we and our ingratitude baſely ſtrive to oppoſe Thee, but nothing can reſiſt thy Almighty Goodneſs: Thou didſt come to thine own People, and they received Thee not; yet thou didſt not forſake the kind deſign of thy coming: When the Impiety of man was treacherouſly plotting to betray and murder Thee, then didſt thou mercifully conſult about means to convey thy ſaving bleſſings to the world: When they were reſolving to bruiſe and kill thy ſacred Body, thou waſt contriving how we might beſt reap advantage from thy Paſſion and Death. Thy love we ſee was deſirous to do more than dye for us, having contrived more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a way to live in us. The Lord Jeſus on the ſame night when he was betray'd, took Bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and ſaid, Take, Eat, this is my Body which was broken for you, this do in remembrance of me: After the ſame manner alſo he took the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60846:64"/> Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of many, Drink ye all of it, and do this as oft as you Drink it, in remembrance of me. Thus has our wiſe Lord found an excellent way to make even our fleſh aſſiſt the Spirit in us: He has contrived by ſenſible things to make us move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heavenly; by thoſe things which are wont to draw and faſten us to this earth. When he diſtributed the Bread and Wine to his Diſciples, he gave them an intereſt in his abundant gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and merits: And thus is he ready to beſtow himſelf ſtill upon thoſe that believe, and are deſirous to partake of him. He has commanded the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Holy Supper to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd in the Chriſtian Church, to the end of the world: And that not only to keep alive a thankful remembrance of his Death, but alſo to confirm his gracious Promiſes to them that believe on him. To the happy Soul then that with faith and thankfulneſs does thus commemorate the dying Love of our Saviour, this Holy Supper is a Feaſt of fat things, and of Wine on the lees
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60846:64"/> well refined. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf will come and Sup with ſuch, and be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make his conſtant abode with them: His Promiſe aſſures his Preſence with them, while they are here on Earth, and that they ſhall when they go hence, be taken up to be where he is. O Praiſe the Lord, ye Nations of the Earth, all praiſe and admire his wiſdom and love: His Love that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſeeks our happineſs, and his Wiſdom that finds ſuch excellent means to accompliſh it: Praiſe him that is the ſole fountain of ſpiritual Bleſſings, and who alone has right to ordain the means of conveying them; for that he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a few means, and thoſe eaſie to be obſerved, and made them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of all the riches of his Grace: Give hearty thanks to the kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for this Inſtitution, and expreſs your thankfulneſs by coming to this his Supper: Come to it to remember his propitiatory Death, and to receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who offers himſelf to you: Come to partake of the important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of his Death, and to devote your ſelves entirely to him who has ſo lov'd you: Come all ye People of the wide
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60846:65"/> world, and let us adore the God that feeds us: With himſelf our kind Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our will feed us, and with his Sacred Fleſh; his ſacred Fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood is drink indeed. Our firſt Parents eat of the forbidden tree, and incurr'd for themſelves and their poſterity an eternal Death: We are invited to a Feaſt of ſpiritual Food, which whoſoever eateth ſhall live for ever. With theſe dainties will divine love nouriſh us up to immortal Life, confirming and encreaſing that happy union with himſelf, which is begun even while we live below on earth, and ſhall be perfected when we come to Heaven.</p>

                     <p>THe kind Maſter of this bleſſed Feaſt, ſends his Embaſſadors to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral invitation. He that is the divine Food puts the kindeſt words into their mouths; that their invitation may not fail of good ſucceſs. He has ſaid, Come to me all ye that labour for Holineſs, and are oppreſs'd under the weight of your ſins: Come, and I will give you the end of your Labour; and will eaſe you of that intolerable burden. Come you that hunger after Angels ſpiritual Food, and thirſt to drink at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of bliſs. Come to me, I will refreſh
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60846:66"/> you with the Wine of gladneſs, and the bread of life. Come you that are weak, and you ſhall be ſtrong: come you that are ſtrong, leſt you become weak. Come you that have leiſure, and here entertain your time to your great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: And you alſo that are buſie, and here ſanctifie and devote your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our glorious God did not only make a viſit, but is willing to dwell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with us men upon earth: He whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, will make his reſidence in our little Tabernacles. He whom the Seraphims proſtrate adore, and fly with all their wings to perform his commands. He who came down to die for us ſinners, and aſcended again above the higheſt Heavens: Himſelf is there with all his precious bleſſings to the Soul that does deſire and believe. To ſuch a Soul this bleſſed Sacrament applies all the vertues, and merits of our Saviours Death and Paſſion. When he receives the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bread and Wine, from the hands of Chriſts Miniſter in his ſtead; he is made a partaker in the Satisfaction of his death, and the Pardon of all his ſins is ſeal'd and confirm'd. By eating the Bread and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60846:67"/> drinking the Wine, the good Soul is more firmly united to the Redeemer: And as a member of his myſtical body ſhall be quickned and guided by his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The indwelling Spirit ſhall teach him his duty, and inable him to run in the way everlaſting. He ſhall communicate power to conquer difficulties and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and to perſevere with patience till he reach the Crown. By this is ſuch a ſoul united alſo to that Jeſus, who roſe again from the death he ſubmitted to. And as it is aſſuredly riſen to a new life of Grace, it ſhall hereafter riſe to an eternal life of Glory. It may look on theſe ſigns as certain pledges that it ſhall be advanced to the happy manſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Thus as our Lord himſelf when on Earth contain'd under his outward po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, all the glorious fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; ſo theſe ſigns that repreſent him to us are but poor in themſelves, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to the rich bleſſings they bring along with them. Whatever faintneſs we feel, if we hunger after Chriſt and come hither to receive him, he can refreſh us. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fears dwell in our guilty minds and trouble us, this Wine of true Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will chaſe them away. O How great
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60846:67"/> is thy Love, Dear Lord, that invites us miſerable ſinners to partake of thee: That invites our emptineſs to be united to thy fulneſs; and our weakneſs to be cured by thy al ſufficient power. O how ſhould the ſons of men flock in when he ſends out his invitations to this Feaſt! when he calls us to a Feaſt of peace and love! A feaſt of joy and incomparable ſweetneſs. What ſhould the Captive wiſh but Liberty, and the weary Pilgrim but reſt? What ſhould the Sick deſire but health, and the depending Creature but to be near its God? All are welcome to this Feaſt that have but Deſire to partake, and Faith to receive.</p>

                     <p>LOrd, who are we unworthy wretches that thou thus regardeſt our ſinful duſt! what is all the world compar'd to Thee, that thus thou ſeemeſt for our ſakes to diſregard thy ſelf! It is for our ſakes, and to make us rich in Grace, that thou ſo graciouſly condeſcendeſt to come among us. More unworthy yet do we make our ſelves, if we neglect to come where thou wilt be preſent. O
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60846:68"/> how inſenſible of their own true intereſt are thoſe that neglect to approach this Sacred Feaſt. Is it a ſmall matter with you, O careleſs wretches, to ly under a great load of guilt, that you come not to receive the pardon of your ſins? Is the Great God willing to be reconcil'd to ſinners, and to give them ſure pledges of his reconcilement? And ſhould not all Mankind then earneſtly ſeek his favour, and gladly receive the pledges of his love? None of us can be aſſur'd that he will not turn us into Hell, till we are aſſur'd of our title to Heaven. Where are all they that have been baptized, and pretend that they account themſelves Chriſtians. Why do they not come, and own the Covenant then made by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again at this Supper? They that neglect this, do in effect renounce that Covenant, and deſpiſe the incomparable bleſſings it promiſes. Well may they be impotent towards all good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the tyranny of evil ſpirits; who neglect this Means appointed to convey ſpiritual ſtrength, and to furniſh them with the Spirit of Grace. Such muſt needs have lamentable cauſe to bewail the weakneſs of their Graces, and the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60846:68"/> ſlow progreſs of their Holineſs. Well may they contract very deep ſtains, that do not often waſh themſelves with the blood of the Lamb. Well may they that begin in the Spirit, ſoon after end in the Fleſh; who do not often here renew their reſolutions, and receive freſh ſtrength to hold on their race. Thoſe were times of vigorous and ſound piety when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had a ſtrong appetite to this Spiriual Food. This Appetite diſcover'd their health, and by often eating they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it: When they could hardly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented a Day without receiving one of theſe bleſſed meals: When they never came together to worſhip, but they alſo broke this holy Bread; Then they were patient under the hardeſt ſufferings, and then they abounded in every good work. Then did the love of Jeſus burn hot in their breaſts, and the light of it ſhined bright before men. Then they had great chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards all men, and much peace one with another. It is a ſad ſign, and may be reckon'd a cauſe that the Spiritual life greatly languiſhes in our daies: When the proper Food of it is little reliſht by many, and a great many more never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. Our ſad dayes are likely ſtill to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60846:69"/> languiſh in devotion, to be over-run with impiety, and profaneneſs: Still will the baſe love of the world abound amongſt us, every one minding his own things, and none the things of Chriſt. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will be enemies to one another, and more barbarous and cruel than wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſts: They will go on to bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their own kind, and to conſume and deſtroy the Chriſtian Church; If we do not oftner commemorate the Love of our Lord, and ſolemnly bind our ſelves to love one another.</p>

                     <p>Does our gracious Lord make a Feaſt of himſelf for us, and invite us poor Sinners to ſit down at his Table? And ſhould we not readily obey his call, and go to the Feaſt he has ſo kindly prepared? Behold our Lord himſelf is willing to meet us, and to bring a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with him to entertain us. O leave the trifles of this world, ye reaſonable Souls, and go to partake of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Joyes: Suſpend the purſuit of tranſitory goods, ye immortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſeek of Chriſt his eternal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60846:69"/> Treaſures. O how ungrateful, Dear Lord, to thee, are all they that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this thy incomparable Proviſion: The Eternal Fathers Love is ſlighted by them, who gave his beloved Son to dye for us: The Love of our kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is not duly valu'd, while we have no eſteem or deſire for the bleſſings he has purchas'd: The ſweet and ſaving Influences of the Holy Spirit are ſet at nought, while we decline the proper means to enjoy them. Is it not a moſt unſpeakable ingratitude in mankind, to trample under foot the Blood of the Son of God? to deſpiſe that precious Blood which was ſhed for our ſakes, which was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſins? ſhould we forget that painful Death he underwent, to excuſe us from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eternal death? It was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge that great Love left, when he was juſt a going to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us; That we ſhould devoutly celebrate this holy Supper, and often do it in remembrance of him. Are we not under great Obligation from his Love, to do any difficult or dangerous thing for his ſake? and much more to comply with his dying will, when it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60846:70"/> requires ſo eaſie, and ſo pleaſant a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Did our Saviour drink Vinegar, and eat Gall for us; and ſhall we refuſe at his command to take theſe pleaſant dainties? He drank off the bitter Cup which the Father gave him, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for us a Cup of bleſſing. O how well would it become the whole world to ſay, We will take the Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and praiſe the name of the Lord: We will remember thy Love more than Wine, dear Lord, and never forget thy moſt uſeful Benefits: We will ſhow that we love thee as we ought to do, by keeping this and the reſt of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Had we but ingenuous Souls, we ſhould be extreamly glad that he who has done ſo much for us, has told us what will pleaſe him. This Feaſt is appointed by our Lord, to ſhew forth his Death 'till he come: For he will come again in Glory and with Power, to Judge both the quick and the dead: When he will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, and ſeverely Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all thoſe that obey not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: What muſt become of all thoſe in that dreadful day, that do conſtantly neglect an undoubted Precept? Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60846:70"/> to fear the incurring of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by unworthy receiving, but do not fear to deſerve it by neglecting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Supper. But ſince we diſobey and offend our Lord in both of theſe, it ſhould be our labour and care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves and draw nigh.</p>

When he might have flown on the wings of Cherubims, he choſe to walk with us Worms in the duſt: When he might have call'd for Manna from Heaven, in the ſweat of his brows he would eat his Bread: When he might have made the Angels his foot-ſtool, he rather became the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his Parents, living with them in their little Cottage, and readily obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even their leaſt Command: There in that humble privacy he encreas'd in wiſdom, and grew in favour with God and man; ſtill by his pious candour gaining the love of thoſe happy few
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60846:73"/> that ſaw his life. Happy they that ſaw thy life, O glorious Jeſu! and heard with joy and wonder thy incomparable ſayings; that felt a gentle motion ſtir their hearts, to love and imitate ſo bleſt a pattern. O that the ſame ſweet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace might draw our minds, dear Lord, to thee! O that we could, my Soul, in every paſſage of our life, ſtill actually reflect on the example of His: His retirements were fill'd with holy Speculations, and in the midſt of buſineſs his mind was free for Heaven: His Converſe with others miſpent no time, but beſtowed every moment in excellent Charity; ſometimes he was imployed to inſtruct the ignorant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to inform aright thoſe that were deceived: He apply'd himſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the afflicted, and heal the diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to convince the froward, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the penitent, and perſwade all the world to be truly happy. It was meat and drink to him to do his Fathers will, and it ſhould be ours to perform his. It was for our ſakes that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſubject to the Law, and to obtain for us an everlaſting happineſs he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey'd it. Take up thy Croſs,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60846:74"/> my Soul, and follow thy Lord; for his yoke is ſweet, his burthen is light. He humbled himſelf for us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs to ſave us. When we had ſold our ſelves to ſin, and were all become the ſlaves of Satan, our bleſſed Jeſus deſcended from Heaven, and brought a vaſt price to buy out our freedom: The price was no leſs than his own deareſt Blood, which he plenteouſly ſhed on the ignominious Croſs, depoſiting ſo his ineſtimable life to reſcue us ſinners from eternal death. Come let us adore our God that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us.</p>

Thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions He ſo patiently endur'd, and bore with Silence all their weight. Even from his humble Cradle in the City of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to his bitter Croſs on the Mount of <hi>Calvary.</hi> How little do we read of glad and proſperous in his Life! how much of pains, and grief, and perpetual affronts! ſometimes he was abandon'd by his neareſt Friends; and left alone among all his diſcomforts: ſometimes purſu'd by his fierceſt enemies; and made the common mark of all their ſpite: ſometimes they plot to inſnare Him in his words; and enviouſly ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his miraculous Deeds: ſometimes they tumultuouſly gather about him; to gaze at and abuſe a man of ſorrows: Sometimes they furiouſly ſeize on his Perſon; and hale and drag him along the ſtreets: At laſt they all conſpire to take away his life; and condemn him to a ſharp, and cruel death. Have you ever ſeen a harmleſs Lamb ſtand ſilent
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60846:75"/> in the midſt of ravenous Wolves? ſo ſtood the Prince of Peace and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, beſieg'd with a ring of ſavage Jews: When they blaſphemed Him, he reply'd not again; and when they inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtruck him, he only obſerv'd their raſhneſs. When they provok't him with their utmoſt Malice, he pleaded their excuſe; and when they kill'd him, he earneſtly pray'd for their Pardon. O ſtrange ingratitude of humane nature; thus barbarouſly to crucifie the Worlds Redeemer! O admirable Love of the worlds Redeemer; thus patiently to dye for humane Nature! Say now, my Soul, for whom thy deareſt Lord endur'd all this and infinitely more; Canſt thou complain of thy little troubles, when the King of Glory was thus afflicted? Canſt thou complain of a meanly furniſht houſe; when the Son of God had not where to lay his head? We wear the badge of a crucified Lord; and ſhall we ſhrink back at every Croſs we meet? we believe in a God that was crown'd with Thorns; and ſhall we abide to tread on nothing but Roſes? Before our eyes, O Jeſu, we ſee thee humble and meek; and ſhall thy Servants be proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60846:76"/> We ſee thee travel up and down poor, and unregarded; and ſhall thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſtrive to be rich, and eſteemed? Thy charitable labours were maliciouſly ſlander'd; and ſhall not our faults have the patience to be reproved? Thou didſt not diſdain to be call'd, thô in ſcorn, <hi>the Carpenters Son;</hi> and cannot our lowneſs bear a little diſparagement? O how unlike are we to that bleſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, who deſcended from Heaven to become our Pattern!

                     <p>ALL this, O Bleſſed Jeſu! thou taughtſt thy Holy Prophets to prepare the World for the coming of a Humble Saviour; all this and infinitely more thou didſt verifie in thine own Perſon, with the reproaches, pains, and inward ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows thou didſt endure. So much as was able to make even patience it ſelf break forth into this ſad complaint: O all you that paſs by behold and ſee, if there be any Sorrow like unto my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. My God, when I conſider what thou

Our Sins were the cauſe of thy cruel death; yet ſtill we permit them to live in us. We entertain the worſt of thine Enemies; and treacherouſly lodge them in our own boſoms.

Many we confeſs are the follies of our Life; and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may very juſtly tremble at their own great Guilt. Many are the times thou haſt graciouſly pardon'd us; and ſtill we relapſe, and abuſe thy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.

Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Tears; that Day and Night I might continually lament my own many Sins, and my dear Saviours Sufferings. But is there, O my Jeſu, any ſtain ſo foul, which thy precious blood cannot waſh away? Is there any heap of Sins ſo vaſt, to exceed the number of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

O no; Thou canſt forgive more than we can offend; but thou wilt not forgive unleſs we fear to offend: Unleſs we ſeek to Thee for Peace, and reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and humble our ſelves in thy Holy Preſence. I will therefore O Lord humbly proſtrate my ſelf before Thee; and caſt my ſelf upon thy infinite Mercy. I will look ſeriouſly into my own Breaſt, and make diligent ſearch for my boſom Sins: I will confeſs and heartily lament my many failings, and ſtrive to correct and amend my ſelf by Faſting and Prayer. All we can offer thy offended Majeſty, to pacifie the Juſtice of thy wrath, is only an humble Eye bath'd in Tears; and a penitent Heart broken with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow: Only a firm reſolve to change our lives; and even all this we muſt beg of Thee.</p>

While we delight in Strife and Schiſm, what do we elſe but rend thy ſeamleſs Coat? If we deſpiſe the leaſt of thy faithful Servants; are we not as ſo many <hi>Herods</hi> that ſcorn'd Thee? If we for Fear proceed againſt our Conſcience; how are we better than <hi>Pilate</hi> that unjuſtly condemn'd Thee? By forſaking thy will to follow our own; do we not chuſe a Murderer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

We ſought not him, but he came from far to find us; we look't not towards him, but his Mercy call'd after us: He call'd aloud in Words of melting tenderneſs; Why will you periſh, O ye Children of Men? Why will ye run after empty trifles; as if there were no joyes above with me? Return, O you Dear bought Souls, and I will receive you; repent, and though you had really crucified me, I will forgive you.

Come let us adore our victorious Redeemer. Thou haſt, O Lord, triumpht over all thy enemies, and ours, but we alas, are yet

                     <p>LOrd, with what admirable Wiſdom doſt thou govern the world, and order the ſeveral conditions of Men! thy wiſe Providence orders ſome to be poor, and appoints them their task of innocent work: Thy Providence is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make others rich, and give them leiſure for their better improvements: Thou haſt made both poor and rich to be ſome way needful to one another,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60846:85"/> that all may live in love and unity, and apply themſelves to mutual aſſiſtance. Happy are they, O Lord, who have ſo much employment, that there remains no room for idle thoughts: Happy are they who have ſo little buſineſs, that they want not ſpace to attend their Souls: Happy yet more are they, who in the midſt of their work, can think ſometimes of the wages above; whom nothing diverts from that chief concern of ſeeking to make their Election ſure: But while their backs are bow'd down with labour, they freely can raiſe up their minds to Heaven: And while they are ty'd to their Beds with ſickneſs, can yet move on towards their Eternal reſt: Often they rejoyce with themſelves alone, and ſilently ſay in their contented hearts, Here we, alas! are narrowly confin'd, and our time entertain'd with trivial affairs: But hereafter we expect an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded enlargement, and the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious office with the bleſſed Angels: Here we are ſubject to a thouſand miſeries, and the moſt proſperous life is vain and ſhort; but hereafter we expect an infinity of Joy, and the ſolid Pleaſures of Heaven for ever. We too, my Soul, let
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60846:86"/> us Pray to be guided in the middle Path, and take care that we decline to no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious extream; to avoid the ſtormy ſea of too much buſineſs, and the dead wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſlothful life; leſt we be caſt away by forgetting God, or become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by neglecting our ſelves. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt recollect thy thoughts, how much ſoever thy condition diſtracts thee: In all thy works remember thy laſt end, when thou muſt bid a long farewel to all this World; Remember that dreadful Day of the Univerſal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when thou muſt give an account for every idle word: Remember the Joyes prepar'd for the Innocent, and the miſeries that attend the wicked: Remember how nearly it concerns thee to have a good or a bad Eternity, and that every action tends towards the one or the other: Thus kept in awe, thou wilt be careful not to ſin, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by the reward thou wilt ſtrive to do well. Then maiſt thou look up with humble confidence in our God, how low ſoever thy afflictions depreſs thee: Thou may'ſt look up to the eternal Mountains, and feed thy hungry deſires with this ſweet hope; the day will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60846:86"/> come, when out of this dark world we ſhall joyfully aſcend to that beauteous light: The day will come, and cannot be far off, when we ſhall reſt for ever in the boſom of Bliſs.</p>

Every place is a Church to ſuch conſecrated Souls, and every day a holy Sabbath: Every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is an occaſion of Piety, and every accident an exerciſe of Vertue. Do they behold the beauteous Stars, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adore their great Creator: Do they look down on the fruitful Earth, they inſtantly begin to praiſe his Bounty:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60846:87"/> Let War or Peace do what they will, and the inconſtant World reel up and down; they paſs through all with a ferene mind, and ſmoothly go on their regular courſe; looking ſtill up to that glorious Life above, and entertaining this preſent in hope, and labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: When they depart ſometimes from their proper center, and forſake a while their belov'd retirement; 'tis to approach and give light to others, and enflame ſome cold or lukewarm hearts: While they are abroad they are ſtill with Thee, and nothing can divide them from thy dear Preſence: When they return, ſtill Devout and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, thou receiveſt them as familiar Friends; and freely admit'ſt them to thy ſecret Sweetneſs: Thou giveſt them a taſt from thine own full board, and overfloweſt their hearts with the Wine of gladneſs. Often they feel a little beam from Heaven ſtrike gently, and fill their breaſts with light; often that gentle light is kindled into a flame, and chaſtly burns with pure deſires: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that ſtill mount up and aim at Thee, the ſupernatural center of all their hopes. Oh happy ſtate of the

                     <p>ALL this is true, and yet the World is lov'd, and our nature inclines to affect its vanities. 'Tis lov'd, and ſo it juſtly deſerves to be, did we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand its real value. Our Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeems trivial and mean, and all things about us look troubleſom and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Yet, O my God, is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence excellent in this; that they are our onely way of coming to thee. This World, and this alone is the Womb that breeds us, and brings us forth to ſee thy light. This is alone the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Machine, wherein thy hand has ſet our Lives; to learn the art of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it right, and wind up our ſelves to thy glorious Heaven. O that we had that happy skill! how ſoon would eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing help forward to advance us! Whether we eat or drink, or whatever elſe an innocent hand can undertake; if we regard our faithful end, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all to the improvement of our minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They inſtantly change their ſecular name,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60846:90"/> and deſervedly are preferr'd to become religious. Riches themſelves, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Honour have not ſo perverſe and fixt a malice; but a prudent uſe converts them to Piety, and makes them fit inſtruments of higheſt Bliſs. Our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delights (O the goodneſs of our God!) may be temper'd with ſo wiſe an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy, that his mercy accounts them as parts of our Duty, and fails not to give them their full reward; while they are entertain'd for the health of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or the juſt refreſhment of our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſpirits; and both our Bodies and Spirits conſtantly apply'd to gain new degrees of the love of Heaven. Thus, gracious Lord, every moment of our lives may ſtill be climbing up towards thee; thus may we ſtill proceed in thy ſervice, even then when we moſt of all ſerve our ſelves: And then indeed it is we beſt ſerve our ſelves, when we are buſieſt in what we call thy ſervice. Thou ſweetly vouchſafeſt to ſtile that thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which in very truth is nothing but our intereſt: Thou kindly complain'ſt we diſhonour thy Name, when we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchief our own Souls.</p>

                     <p>THis Life indeed is the way we muſt walk; but this alone cannot bring us to our end. E're we arrive at our appointed home, we muſt be led through the Gates of Death; where we ſhall abſolutely be ſtript of all we have; and carry nothing with us but what we are. Where we not only muſt quit the whole World; but leave behind us even part of our ſelves. Haſt thou, my Soul, ſeen ſome Neighbour dye? and doſt thou remember thoſe circumſtances of Sorrow? We are ſure, the Caſe e're long will be our own; and are not ſure but it may be very ſoon. Have we our ſelves been dangerouſly ſick? and do we remember the thoughts we had then? How we reſolv'd to correct our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſtrive againſt the vices that particularly endanger us. It will come to this again; and no reprieve ſhall be found to ſtay one ſingle Minute the hand of Death: But he immediately will ſeize upon us, and bear us away to the Region of ſpirits; there to be rang'd in our proper place; as the courſe of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60846:91"/> our Life has qualified us here. Nor is this all, to expire, and dye; and dwell for a time in a ſtate of Separation. We muſt expect another day; a day of publick accounts, and reſtitution of all things: When the Arch-Angel ſhall ſound his Trumpet, and proclaim aloud this univerſal ſummons: Ariſe you dead, and come to Judgment; ariſe, appear befor the Throne of God. Then ſhall the little heaps of Duſt immediately awake; and every Soul put on again her proper Body. Immediately all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from Heaven, and Hell, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of the Earth. There they muſt ſtand, and all attend their doom; but O with how ſad and fatal a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence! The Juſt ſhall look up with a chearful confidence; and in their new white robes triumph and ſing: <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ja,</hi> let us rejoice, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come; and his Bride has prepar'd her ſelf. Let us rejoice, for the Kingdom of the World is made our Lords, and his Chriſts; and he ſhall Reign for ever and ever. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, for now our Redeemer is nigh; behold he comes quickly, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60846:91"/> is with him. Come, come, Lord Jeſu, thou long deſire of our Hearts; come quickly thou full delight of our Souls: Come, and declare to all the world thy Glory; come, and reward before all the World thy Servants. Lo, where aloft he comes in Power, and Majeſty; attended with a train of innumerable Angels. Behold where he ſits enthron'd on the Wings of Cherubims, and takes at once a view of all mankind. Soon he commands his Angels to ſever his ſheep; and gather them together on his Right hand. Firſt then to them he turns his glorious Face, and ſhines upon them, and ſaies theſe raviſhing words: Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſs the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World. O the joyes their Souls ſhall feel, when thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Words ſound in their Ears; Joyes that the wit of man cannot conceive; joyes that the Tongues of Angels cannot expreſs. Let it ſuffice, themſelves ſhall taſt their own felicity; and feed on its ſweetneſs for ever. But O, with what dejected Eyes and trembling Hearts ſhall the wicked ſtand expecting their Judge! What ſhall they do when, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60846:92"/> they look, their griev'd Eye can meet with nothing but what will cauſe deſpair? Above the offended Judge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to condemn them; below the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit gaping to devour them Within the worm of Conſcience gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Bowels, and round about them all the world is in flames. What ſhall they do when that terrible voice ſhall ſtrike them ſuddenly down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell? Go you accurſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire, prepar'd for the Devil, and his Angels. The day of man is paſt, when Sinners did what they pleas'd; and God ſeem'd to hold his Peace. 'Tis now the day of God, when his wrath ſhall ſpeak in thunder; and Sinners ſhall ſuffer what their wickedneſs deſerves. Then ſhall they ſink immediately into the Pit of Sorrow; and dwell in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and torments for ever. While the juſt ſhall go up in Joy and Triumph; and Reign with our Lord in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever. Thus ſhall the whole Creation be finally diſpos'd; and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice divide the world. O my Soul! who now art here below, and read'ſt theſe dreadful Truths as things afar off: Know thou ſhalt be preſent
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60846:92"/> and ſee them with thine Eyes, and be thy ſelf concern'd for all Eternity. Know as thou liveſt, thou art ſure to die; and as thou dieſt thou art ſure to be judged. Think what a ſad condition it will be to find thy ſelf on the wrong hand: Think what then thou would'ſt give to have repented in time; think what thou would'ſt give for a little time to repent. Think on theſe things, and now heartily repent while yet a moment of time is left thee. Improve this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the neceſſary work, becauſe thou canſt not be aſſur'd of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another. Watch, now, thy ſelf continually, and continually pray; for we know not the Hour when the Son of man will come.</p>

                        <p>O Son of God and Man, who cameſt in Mercy to ſave! O bring the ſame Mercy with Thee, when thou comeſt to Judge us. In the mean while aſſiſt me by thy heavenly Grace, to ſtand perpetually with my accounts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that I may die in the Peace of God, and Communion of his Church,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60846:93"/> and go to live with him, and that part of his Holy Church which is trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. O Bleſſed Jeſu! King of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and great rewarder of every little Grace! Thou who by all we can do pretendeſt no gain, but beſtoweſt on us all that thy ſelf haſt done: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct my gratitude to conſecrate all to Thee, ſince all by thy bounty will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to thy ſelf. O Thou who tookſt upon Thee all our frailty, to beſtow on us thine own perfections, teach me to prize the joyes of Heaven, and part with all things elſe to purchaſe Thee. O let not the flatteries of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures any more delude me! nor any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous cares perplex my mind. O may my chief delight be to think of thee, all my ſtudy to come to the enjoyment of thee. Let the ſhortneſs and vexation of all worldly enjoyments ſo diſparage them to my Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may become leſs tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, and take the leſs hold of my heart. Make me thankfully ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thy mercy and kindneſs to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in mixing this worlds enjoyments with ſo much trouble and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſince we cannot attain thee, the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60846:93"/> Heaven of Heavens, if we do not fix our ſelves intirely upon thee: Nor can we do this if we are or may be ſatisfied with any thing beſide thy glorious ſelf. Thus has thy wiſdom fitly qualified this life, the preſent dark womb of our Souls, ſo that by its own uneaſineſs it will with thy bleſſing the more eaſily diſpoſe them for a happy birth into thy bleſſed Eternity: Through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt thy Son, who with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt together, is worſhipped and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>

                     <p>SIng to our Lord a Pſalm of Joy, ſing Praiſes to the God of our Salvation: Sing with a loud and chearful Voice, ſing with a glad and thankful Heart: Say to the weak of ſpirit, Be ſtrong; ſay to the ſtaggering Faith, Be ſtedfaſt; ſay to the ſorrowful, Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Tell all the World this Soul-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving truth, and may their Hearts leap within them to hear it: Tell them the Lord of life is riſen again, and has cloath'd himſelf with immortal glory: He made the Angels Meſſengers of his Victory, and vouchſaf't even himſelf to bring us the happy news. How many wayes did thy condeſcending mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, O thou wiſe contriver of all our happineſs! to convince thy followers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60846:97"/> into this bleſt belief, and ſettle in their Hearts a firm ground of hope: Thou appearedſt to the holy Women, in their return from thy Sepulcher, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt their eyes to know and adore thee: Thou didſt purpoſely overtake in their Journey two of thy Diſciples, that were diſcourſing of Thee, and make their hearts burn within them by thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whilſt thou didſt kindly expound to them the things that related to thee in all the Scriptures, and which by thee had been fulfill'd. Thou didſt ſhow thy ſelf on the Shore to thy Diſciples labouring at Sea, to intimate that they muſt now leave that fiſhing to become Fiſhers of Men: They labour'd all night in vain, without the Bleſſing of their Maſter Jeſus: Thou didſt ſhow thy ſelf to them, and tell them plainly who thou wert, by the kind known token of a beneficial Miracle: When the doors of the Houſe were ſhut, thou who hadſt inſenſibly come in, didſt appear to give them peace and ſatisfaction; to ſatisfie them of thy Reſurrection from the dead, and of thy continued tender Love to them: How didſt thou conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to eat before them, and invite
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60846:97"/> them to touch thy Body! How didſt thou ſweetly provoke the incredulous <hi>Thomas</hi> to thruſt his hand into thy wounded ſide: And thou haſt taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from his hardneſs to believe, to facilitate the Faith of thy Church in after Ages. We bleſs Thee, O Lord, who has ſo order'd the Duties of our Faith, that the true reports of Senſe may help us in ſome of them, and do contradict us in none. How often, O gracious Lord, in thoſe bleſſed forty dayes, did thy Charity caſt to meet with thy Diſciples! that thou mighteſt teach them ſtill ſome excellent truth, and imprint ſtill deeper thy Love in their Hearts: Diſcourſing perpetually of the Kingdom of Heaven, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper means to bring us thither. At laſt when all thy glorious task was perfectly finiſht, and thy hour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from this Earth did approach, Thou didſt tenderly gather thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren about thee, and in their full ſight goe up into Heaven; leaving thy dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſing on their heads, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a kind Comforter in thy abſence. O how adoreable are thy Counſels, O Lord! How ſtrangely endearing the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60846:98"/> wayes of thy Love! Say now, my Soul, is not this evidence clear enough, to anſwer all our darkeſt Doubts? Is not this hope abundantly ſufficient to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all our bittereſt Sorrows? What though we mourn and be afflicted here, and ſigh under the Miſeries of the world for a time? we may be ſure that our Tears ſhall one day be turn'd into Joy, and that Joy none ſhall be able to take from us: What though our Bodies be crumbled into duſt, and that duſt ſhould be blown about over the face of the whole Earth? Yet we undoubtedly know that our Redeemer lives, and ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in brightneſs at the laſt Great Day. He ſhall appear in the midſt of all the numerous Hoſts of Angels, and before him ſhall be brought all Nations: Then with theſe Eyes which now read of him, we ſhall ſee him; we ſhall ſee him in whom we have ſo long believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhall find him whom we have ſo often ſought: In our full and final Redemption we ſhall find him a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mighty Redeemer: We ſhall poſſeſs him whom our Souls have loved, and be united to him for ever, who is the only end of our being.</p>

He aroſe, and made the light his Garment, and commanded the Clouds to be the Chariot of his Triumph. The

Enter, bright King, thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Palace, attended with thy ſhining Angels; enter with the glad train of thy new delivered Captives, the firſt Fruits of thy Victory, and the earneſts of more. Enter, and repoſſeſs thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Throne, and reign eternally at the right hand of thy Father. May every Knee bow low at thy exalted Name, and every Tongue confeſs thy Glory. May all created Nature adore thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Church of thy Redeemed exult in thy goodneſs. Whom have we in Heaven but thee, O Lord, who didſt expreſly go thither to make way for thy followers? What have we on Earth that yields us any comfort and delight, but our hope by following thee to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at laſt where thou art gone before us? And worth our while, O Lord, it is to follow thee in the greateſt labour of doing well, and in patience under the greateſt Adverſities; ſince the end of all is, that where thou art we ſhall be.

He died for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification. In this we ſee a full ſatisfaction made for our ſins by his death: Hereby he ever lives to make interceſſion for us ſinners. O let all the World rejoyce in the Victory and Triumph of our Lord over all the Enemies of our Salvation. I bleſs thee, O my Saviour, for thy Death, and I praiſe and adore thee for thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: The one a work of infinite condeſcending Mercy; the other of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power. And now, my Soul, how art thou conformable to thy kind Lord, if when he is riſen, thou lye dead in treſpaſſes and ſins? If thou be not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with Chriſt to a new and ſpiritual
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60846:100"/> Life, certainly thou art none of his, Will he not draw all his own thus after him? Will he ſuffer any of them to lye entangled in earthly deſires? If he has not drawn thy heart from the World, and from thy ſelf, and made thee value him moſt, and delight to run the way of his Commandments; thou haſt no part in him. And if thou be riſen with Chriſt, thou ſhould'ſt ſeek thoſe things which are above. Why ſhould our Hearts dwell on Earth, when the beſt Treaſure of our Hearts is return'd to Heaven? Since our glorified Jeſus is aſcended above, to prepare us a place in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?

                     <p>O Sin, how haſt thou diſturbed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded this our miſerable World. Before Sin entred, nothing but Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwelt here. Sin has diſordered the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60846:102"/> Nature of Mankind, and of every thing elſe. The Righteous Vengeance of God has laid a deſerved Curſe upon the whole Creation: Now is unhappy man born to trouble, as the ſparks of Fire are to fly upward. Poor Mankind, this is not the place of thy reſt, becauſe thy Sin has defil'd it. Thou art liable to receive hurt and trouble from all things here below; and thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be happy till thou art tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. Heaven only is the Place of true and laſting Joy, the place of eaſe and ſecure reſt. Who will give my weary Soul the wings of a Dove, that I may fly away and be at reſt? That I may leave this dangerous, dark, uncomfortable, vexatious world. That I may fly away from the troubles of this Life and be at reſt, Dear Lord, with Thee. Here we, alas! are forced to utter many a deep Sigh, to bear with grief the burthen of weighty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries: Often we encounter chances that endanger us, and divert our progreſs in the way of Bliſs: Often we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with temptations that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, and ſet us back in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Eternity. How many times,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60846:103"/> O my Soul, have we plainly concluded that this Earth affords no real Joy. When we have obſerved by our own experience, or by the carriage of others, that the enjoyment never preforms that which the expectation promiſes. How many times have we fully agreed that Heaven alone is the place of Happineſs: When we have found all places and conditions here encombred with Vanity and Vexation. Yet theſe falſe allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do again, and again deceive us, and ſeduce our Hearts to dote on fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We have found that which glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd like Gold to be but droſs, and yet we are caught again with ſomething elſe that gliſters. Thus do we fooliſh and unconſtant Creatures, forget our wiſeſt reſolves, and the mean-while we neglect our true felicity. My Soul, to be Wiſe and Happy thou muſt only Thirſt and Sigh after thy God: He is the living Fountain of the true Rivers of Pleaſures. Thou muſt deſpiſe all other delights, and ſet thy affections entirely on the joyes which the bliſſeful enjoyment of him affords. Nothing can ever ſatisfie thy deſires but He, and he alone can do this. O then ſeek nothing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60846:103"/> ſo much as him; ſeek nothing be ſure that ſtands in competition with him. To ſeek him is to ſave thy ſelf, for thou ſhalt find him: but by ſeeking other things in neglect of him, thou wilt loſe him and thy ſelf and them. Nothing but labour, diſquiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt will attend thy ſeeking other things, and the enjoyment of them will not render thee free from thoſe.</p>

'Tis on the proud thou lookeſt afar off; but inclineſt thine Ear to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek. Thoſe who delight in the Peace of a contented mind, and limit their thoughts to their own little Sphear: Who never intermedle with the actions of others, unleſs where Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Charity to men, or Piety to God does ingage them: Whoſe lov'd employment is to ſit in ſilence, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the Happineſs, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60846:104"/> hereafter. To contemplate the joyes of Saints and Angels; and the bliſsful Face of our Glorified Jeſus. O how ſecure, and ſweetly do they ſleep; who go to bed with a quiet Conſcience! Who after a day of honeſt painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, in a courſe of juſt and pious living, lay down their wearied Heads in Peace, and ſafely reſt in the Boſom of Providence. If they awake their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Comforts them in the Dark, and bids them not fear the ſhadow of Death: No nor even Death it ſelf; but confidently look up, and long for the dawn of that Eternal day that ſucceeds it. This too, my Soul, ſhould be our care; to note and cenſure and correct our ſelves: To ſtrive for Maſtery over our paſſions that moleſt us; and diſmiſs from our thoughts what does no way concern us. Are not our own occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons buſineſs enough to fill as much time as this Life deſerves? Does not the other at leaſt deſerve every Minute of leiſure that we can ſpare from this? Let then the worldly men purſue their fancied liberties; and ſay and do as they think fit: What's that to Thee, my Soul! who ſhalt not anſwer for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

Follow the way that leads to Truth; follow the Truth that leads to Life. Follow the ſteps of thy beloved Jeſus; who alone is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Follow his Holineſs in what he did; follow his Patience in what he ſuffer'd. Follow him that calls thee with a thouſand bounteous Promiſes; kindly condeſcending to invite, when he might only command; and who will crown thoſe that follow him, with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Rewards. Follow thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord, O my Soul, to the end; and thou maiſt be ſure in the end to enjoy him for ever.</p>

                     <p>COme, let us Meditate the Praiſes of our God, and joyfully recite his divine Perfections: His Being is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, and no dependance his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſſence knows: His Knowledge fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms the vaſt extent of all things; and with his Power he commands and diſpoſes them as he pleaſes: His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſupreamly Infinite, and all his glorious Attributes tranſcendently ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Come, let us Meditate the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our God, and joyfully recite his divine Perfections: He is the ſource of all Felicity; eternally full of his own unchangeable Bliſs; before time began, he was; and when the Sun muſt loſe its light, his bright day will remain the ſame for ever: The Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is the Palace of his Glory, and all created nature the ſubject of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60846:108"/> In his Preſence the brighteſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims cover their Faces, and all the bleſſed Spirits bow down their Heads to his Foot-ſtool. It is the lov'd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of thoſe Spirits, to ſing aloud the eminent Prerogatives of their God and ours; let us then ſtretch our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thoughts to exalt the divine Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But O moſt glorious and dreadful Deity, how dare we Wretches under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thy Praiſe! How dare our ſin-pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Lips pronounce thy Name? or where ſhall we ſeek expreſſions fit for thee? All we can ſay, is nothing to thy unſpeakable Excellencies; all we can think, but a faint ſhadow of thy unconceivable Beauties: Even the Voice of Angels is too low to reach thy worth, and their higheſt Strains fall infinitely ſhort of Thee. Only in this ſhall thy Servants rejoyce, and all the Powers of our Souls be glad, that thy ſelf alone art thy full Praiſe; that all thy Works, meerly in what they are, do Praiſe thee: Thou haſt magnified thy ſelf in making the Creatures. The boundleſs Ocean of Being would not contain his Streams, but overflow'd upon pure nothing, and out of nothing a beauteous World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60846:109"/> Be to thy ſelf, O great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, thine own glory, as thou haſt made all things for thy ſelf. Live, our great God, eternally encompaſt with the beams of thine own inacceſſible light: Live, our ador'd Creator, and reign for ever on the Throne of thine own immortal Kingdom.</p>

Every Element is fill'd with his Bleſſings, and all the World with his liberal Miracles; He ſpake the word and they were made, he commands, and they are ſtill preſerv'd; He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns their motions in perfect order, and diſtributes to each his proper Office, contriving the whole into one vaſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, a ſpacious Theater of his own unlimited Greatneſs.

Not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, O gracious God, did thy hand produce thoſe happy Spirits above, but partly to receive in charge thy little Flock, and watch them in this Wilderneſs till thou gathereſt them to folds of Bliſs. Not for themſelves at all, O Bounteous Lord, were the reſt of this huge Creation fram'd, but to ſuſtain our Lives in the way, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us on to our Eternal home.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60846:114"/> Thus has thy Wiſdom mixed our Life, and beauteouſly interwoven it with reſt and work; whoſe mutual change ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en each other, and both prepare us for our greateſt duty: That of finiſhing here the work of our Salvation, to reſt hereafter in thy Holy place. In like manner, thy wiſe Providence, O Lord! has appointed that after a little time of toil and trouble, death ſhould call thy Saints away to a ſtate of reſt. Thou doſt not, we thank thee, oblige us to conflict with the difficulties and evils of this Life till the day of retribution comes. Thou ſoon calleſt us to a place where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and our ſubtle adverſary the Devil from tempting us; Where our own appetites and paſſions ſhall ſtrive no more againſt our Reaſon and Conſcience: Where our Innocence ſhall be no longer aſſaulted or endanger'd by the threatnings or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of this World: Our Souls are enlarged to a ſpacious liberty, being let out from this priſon of the Body, and go to dwell in the region of Spirits: While our Bodies quietly reſt in their ſilent grave; till they riſe again to Immortal Glory. And thou haſt deſign'd, O Lord,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60846:114"/> that they ſhall awake again from the ſleep of Death, and riſe even from the bed of the Grave. And then indeed there comes a Morning which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſucceeded by an Evening; a waking time for the body, after which it ſhall ſleep no more. It riſes indeed to work again, but that work never tires it any more: that work is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the reſt it leaves. There needs no interruption of that work to ſweeten it, which is eternally pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>

                     <p>LOrd, how does thy bounty give us all things elſe with a large and open hand! Our Fields at once are cover'd with Corn, and our Trees bow under the weight of their Fruit. At once thou filleſt our Magazines with plenty, and ſendeſt us whole ſhowers of other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Only our time thou diſtilleſt by drops, and never giveſt us two moments at once. But takeſt away one, while thou lendeſt another, to teach us to prize ſo precious a Jewel. That we may learn to value every hour, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60846:115"/> not childiſhly ſpend them upon trifles: Much leſs maliciouſly murther whole daies, in purſuing a courſe of Sin and Shame. It was thy Mercy too, O Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, to diſperſe by parcels our portion of time: That the ſucceeding day may learn to grow wiſe, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect its faults by experience of the paſt. Elſe, if our being were all at once, as it ſhall be in the next, the Eternal Life; our Sins would have here no power to be repented, and then alas how deſperate were we! We who are born in the way to Miſery, and unleſs we change can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be happy. We, who ſo often wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully go aſtray, and unleſs we return muſt periſh for ever. Thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed our time, O Soveraign Lord, beyond which we cannot paſs. When thou takeſt away our breath, we die; we return to the duſt, and our place here ſhall know us again no more for ever. Thou commandeſt the grave to diſpenſe with none, but indifferently to ſeize us all alike: That all alike may provide for the fatal hour of death, and none may be undone with miſtaken hopes. Thou telleſt us plainly we muſt dye, but kindly concealeſt the time and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60846:115"/> place, that every where we may ſtand upon our guard, and every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thy coming.</p>

                     <p>WHy do we ſo much bemoan our ſelves, and complain for the neceſſity of dying? Seems it ſo hard a fate to tread the path, which all our Anceſtors have gone before us. <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt of men, and <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God: <hi>David</hi> the man after Gods own Heart, and the Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Mother of our Lord. All theſe have paid their debt to Nature, and ſubſcribed to the Law of univerſal Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Yea, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the Eternal Son of God expir'd on the Croſs; and went to his Glory through the Gates of Death. And ſhall our fond ſelf-love ſo blindly flatter us, as to make us wiſh an exemption from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fate? Should we not be glad that a troubleſome Life will have an end; and rejoice to get out of danger into ſafety, from a ſtormy Sea to a quiet Harbour. This Life is ſo encombred with evils, that we have reaſon to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60846:116"/> thankful it will not laſt alwayes, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wiſh than complain that it may not laſt long. If we die in Old age, Death ſhould be very welcome to us after a long and tedious voyage: If in our Youth we die, it prevents a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand calamites; a thouſand dangers of ruining our Souls. What need we be poſſeſt with fear at thinking how many kinds of Death there are, we are ſure there is but one for us? Dying is an act to be done but once, and if it be once well done, we are happy for ever. Our dayes perhaps are too few to grow rich in, or to ſatisfie the ambition of a haughty Spirit. But to be taught the Love of God, and the Meek and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life of Jeſus; requires not ſo much the number of years, as the faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and prayers of a pious Mind. Would we beſtow on the improvement of our Souls, the time we vainly trifle away; our day would be ſhort enough and not ſeem tedious, and yet would be long enough to finiſh our appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed task. And what, O Glorious Lord, is our buſineſs here, but to trim our Lamps and await thy coming: To ſow the Immortal ſeed of Hope, and expect
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60846:116"/> to receive the happy encreaſe! It is no matter how late the fruit be gather'd, if ſtill it go on in growing better: No matter how ſoon it fall from the Tree, if it be not blown down before 'tis ripe.</p>

A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer that could conquer Sin and Death; and cruſh the Serpents head, who drew us into miſery: A Redeemer that could fully repair the breaches our ſin had made, and render our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better than before.

O Bleſſed Jeſu! our Strength, our Guide; who knoweſt and doſt pity our weak Capacities; and in thy tender care haſt ſo contrived the way to our happineſs, that nothing can undoe us but our own perverſeneſs; nothing but the wilful love of Sin and Death. How eaſie haſt thou made the way to Heaven! how light is the burthen thou lay'ſt on thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers! It is but to believe in thee the God of Truth; but to love thee our greateſt Benefactor; but to deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the ſeeing thee, that thou requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and doing thus we are ſure to poſſeſs an Eternity of Joy.

                     <p>BEhold, our faithful Lord has remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his word: He has raiſed up in the World the long expected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put his word in his mouth, and he has kindly and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently taught us. Light with him is come into the World, to lead us through the Wilderneſs of Life into the true <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> that is above. Admirable wert thou, O Lord, in thy merciful Promiſe; but infinitely more in thy wonderful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Thou didſt not depute an Angel to ſupply the place of a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor entruſt ſo great a work to the management of a Seraphim; but didſt thy ſelf bow the Heavens, and come down, and with thine own bleſt hands work our Redemption. Thy ſelf didſt take upon thee our frail Nature, and vouchſafe to be born of a humble Virgin, condeſcending to the weakneſſes of a Child; a Child whoſe Parents were poor, and of no eſteem in the World. So did he make himſelf of no reputation. He did not decline the mean entertainment of a Stable. O how unfit was that for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60846:121"/> the Birth of the King of Heaven! He contented himſelf with a Manger inſtead of a convenient Cradle; and with the homely, uneaſie lodging of a Bed of Straw; refuſing the ſoft Accommodations of the Rich, to undergoe the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of a poor Stranger. Thus, Lord, at the coſt of thy own eaſe, haſt thou inſtructed us to deſpiſe the World. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the faithful <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtood waiting on thee, and provided as he was able for his helpleſs Family: Onely thy pious Mother dearly embrac't thee, and wrapt thy tender Limbs in little clouts. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, O Heavens, at this: Ye Angels, who had ſeen before many wonders, for this ſurpaſſes all beſides. Be amazed, O Earth, and let every Creature there hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bow the head and knee: Bow all, and adore this incomprehenſible Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt with us: But moſt of all we who are moſt concern'd, the guilty Children of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Adam;</hi> let us bow down our faces to the low duſt; and all proſtrate adore ſo unſpeakable a mercy. Behold, my Soul, thus low my Saviour ſtoopt for me, to check the aſpiring pride of my corrupted Nature. Behold, thus low he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60846:121"/> ſtoopt to take me from the ground, and raiſe me to the felicities of his own Kingdom. Riſe willingly with him, my Soul, from baſe ſenſuality; leave the low Earth with thy deſires, and ſeek a better Countrey; ſo ſhall this God not be aſham'd to be call'd thy God. Lift up thy Voice too with Joy, O my Soul, and ſing <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the new-born Jeſus: With bleſſed Angels celebrate his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly humble birth, and ſay, Glory be to God on high, for peace on earth, and good will towards men. Lift up thy Voice aloud, O my Soul, lift up your Voices all ye his Saints, and joyn the Praiſes of the Church to the Hymns of Heaven.</p>

He caſt out Devils by his awful command, and forc'd them to confeſs and adore his Perſon: He rais'd the dead from the very Grave to Life, the dead that was four dayes buried, and was corrupting; Nay, even himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>GOod God, how extreamly ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are Mankind! How ſtrangely inſenſible of our manifeſt Duty: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature performs its Duties, but we who alone are made capable to underſtand and know ours: Every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lives by rule, but we who have reaſonable Souls to direct our actions. We, O Lord, are moſt beholden to thee of all the lower Creation, and we alone of all prove rebellious againſt thee: The other Creatures live by thy wiſe rules, and ſo do ſerve and attain their particular ends. And thus does every Creature reach its true dignity and honour, while Man baſely falls far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his, in neglecting the rules of that Law which thou haſt given to be his direction. The Sun obſerves his place of riſing, and ſets exactly at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60846:124"/> time: The Sun ſtands ſtill if thou commandeſt, and goes back to obey thy will; and yet the Sun pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to no reward, nor looks to be placed in a higher Heaven. But we who expect the performance of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, we forget and neglect the Law of our God; a Law that brings great rewards with the obſervance of it in this Life, and is followed by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the next. Thy Law, O Lord, written in our Hearts, perfects our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted natures, by reſtoring to us thy glorious Image in righteouſneſs and true holineſs: Thy Law fills the dark mind with chearing light, and makes the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truly wiſe: Thy Law raiſes the will to its true Liberty, and frees it from the fetters of ſin: It tames the unruly Paſſions and Appetites of the fleſh, and ſettles a happy Peace within us: If we are ſo wiſe and happy as not to be diſcouraged from obſerving it by the little difficulty which attends it at firſt, our ſteady perſeverance in well doing will find it eaſie, and incomparably plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Thy Laws will diſpoſe us to paſs with comfort through the various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Life; and they will
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60846:124"/> alſo prepare us to enter at the end of it, into the pure manſions of Heaven. For our kind Lord has prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs to reward them with, who love Him and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Thy bounteous goodneſs, O Lord, will reward us, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty; thou wilt reward us for doing what is good for our ſelves. Thy Laws are all Holy and Juſt and Good, and thy Rewards are unconceivable and Eternal Joyes. O what Blindneſs and Folly poſſeſſes the ſinful world, who neglect and refuſe ſo great advantages!</p>

                     <p>Does it become Mankind for whom Chriſt died to neglect his ſacred Laws? Shall we ſay of him, who has done ſo much for us, he ſhall not reign over us? ſhall we neglect ſo Gracious a Saviour, whoſe only deſign is to draw us to his love? Shall we neglect ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a love, whoſe only deſign is to make us Happy. Yet, O Lord, how are thy juſt Commands neglected in the World! How few are there that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60846:125"/> they love Thee by keeping them! And indeed, to ſay the World generally neglect to keep thy Commands, is too mild a reproof for us, who in many inſtances directly contradict them. What thou forbiddeſt we eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as if our kind Saviour had therein envied us ſome great advantage. And whatever thou commandeſt, we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtill to do the contrary, as if the thing thou requireſt were hurtful. We boldly converſe with temptation and ſin, which thy Charity adviſes us to fly like Death. We timerouſly dread the incurring any worldly loſſes, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of men; when thou command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt us to proceed with undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And we do not ſtand in aw of the Wrath of Almighty God, nor fear the loſs of our own Souls, when thou threatneſt us with them to reſtrain us from Sin. We greedily purſue the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vanities of this World, which thou forbiddeſt us to ſet our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are by them too eaſily drawn into Sin: But the greater goods of a better world we ſlight, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be allured by them to Holineſs. We govern our actions by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60846:125"/> our own wild fancies, and expect that thy Providence ſhould comply with our Humours. We would have Thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us when we liſt; and Rain, and Shine as we think fit. Thus is our rude perverſeneſs, O Lord, apt in every thing to go contrary to Thee.</p>

                     <p>IT was not alone to make the day, that thou, O Lord, didſt make a Glorious Sun. But to teach us theſe pious Leſſons too, and write them plain as its own Beams. That ſo ſhould our light ſhine forth to others, and direct them to glorifie God: So ſhould our Charity warm their coldneſs, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them to an active Zeal for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. So when they ſay, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud of Adverſity, we ſhould like the Sun be really above it. And though to the ſight of men, we may be eclips'd by diſadvantageous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and may ſeem quite extinguiſht in a Night of Sorrow and Affliction: Still we ſhould ſhine to our ſelves and God; and ſtill go on in the waies of light. Though we become ſmall and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60846:126"/> deſpiſed in the Eye of the World, yet we ſhould not forſake thy Law. So ſhall we after the viciſſitudes of bright and dark, of fair weather and foul, which we muſt expect to meet with in this World, enjoy an Eternal bright and ſerene day. Not like the Sun that every Night goes down, and muſt at laſt be put quite out: When we have finiſht here our courſe, and ſeem to ſet to this dark Earth; we hope to riſe, and ſet no more; but ſhine perpetually in a brighter Heaven. And this ſweet Hope, my Soul, may juſtly allay the grief of thy preſent Afflictions.

Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever be thy Name, O Jeſu! and bleſſed be the ſweetneſs of thy Wiſdom; whoſe infinite Charity has vouchſaf't our Earth ſuch excellent Rules to guide it to Heaven: Thou haſt taught us that happy Skill of finding our lives, by a generous loſing them to follow thee: Thou haſt taught us to love our true ſelves beſt, by wiſely hating our miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60846:129"/> ſelves: Thou haſt taught us to trample this world under our feet, and uſe it as a ſtep to climb up to the next: From thee we learn thoſe glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries that exalt our Faith ſo high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Reaſon: From thee we derive thoſe Heroick Counſels, that raiſe our Souls ſo far above nature; from thee alone, and from thy School of grace we learn all that we know, and receive power for all that we do. How long, alas, might we have wander'd here, in the midſt of Darkneſs and Error; had not thy love and pity, O merciful Lord, brought down thy very ſelf to become our light! Never ſhould we elſe have learnt to deny our ſelves, and take up our Croſs and follow thee: Never ſhould we have known that great ſecret of Peace, to forgive our Enemies, and do good to thoſe who deſpitefully uſe us. On the unſatisfying things of this low Earth, ſhould we blindly have ſet our whole Affections, if thou hadſt not told us of the Kingdom of Heaven, and bid us lay up our treaſures there: We had alwayes choſe the deceitful and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wayes of ſin, if thou hadſt not terrified us to fear thy wrath, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60846:130"/> the miſeries that attend them: We ſhould ever have neglected thy good Commands, and loſt the happineſs of a religious life, if thou hadſt not invited us to obey thy Commands, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us the felicities that will attend our doing ſo. O what haſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Gracious Lord, to the meek and poor in Spirit! O what haſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Weepers here? to thoſe that hunger and thirſt after Holineſs! How many Joyes has thy bounty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the lovers of Mercy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Peace! How many Bleſſings for the pure of Heart, and thoſe who with Patience bear their Croſſes: Thus haſt thou, Lord, kindly ſhown us our end; and ſuggeſted the true way to attain it: Thou haſt given us ſuch bleſſed directions, as tend to make our Life here more ſweet, and to lead us hereafter to everlaſting Felicity.</p>

                     <p>NEver will we ceaſe to exalt thy Goodneſs, O gracious Jeſu; ſince thou never ceaſeſt to oblige us with new Bleſſings. Thy generous Charity could not be thus ſatisfi'd, to have only ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us the words of Life; it was not enough for thy exceſſive Love, that thy heavenly Sermons told us our duty, but thou would'ſt moreover urge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our Obedience by the ſweet enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thine own Example. Thou didſt forbid thy followers to affect Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and accordingly thine own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was a few Barly Loves. Thou didſt command the rich to give Alms with chearfulneſs; ſo thou wenteſt about doing good, and didſt often relieve thoſe that were not able to requite thee. Thou haſt commanded us not to fear them which can kill the Body; and yielded up thine own to the death upon the Croſs, to do the will of him that ſent thee, thou waſt obedient even unto death. Thou haſt commanded Subjection to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and practiſed it; haſt ſaid, Give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60846:131"/> and wrought a Miracle to pay a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. Thou injoyneſt us Mercy and Compaſſion; and who ever expreſt more than thy ſelf? Thou didſt not only weep in Sympathy with the Affliction of thy Friends; but alſo over the hard and ſtubborn <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had killed thy Prophets, and was ready to kill thee. Thou enjoyneſt us to love our fierceſt Enemies, and thy dying breath pray'd for thy Crucifiers. Thy perfect Soul did not need, as our weak Natures do, the outward Forms and Diſcipline of Religion; yet thou didſt conform to the obſervance of the common appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Feaſts, and aſſiſt in the publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the Temple. Thou didſt watch and pray with ſo fervent a Zeal, that thy Practice was perfectly equal to thy Precepts. This Life, and even Death it ſelf our merciful Lord undertook, to mark out for us the way to Heaven. To beat it plain by his own ſacred Steps, and render our paſſage thither eaſie and ſecure. Shall we not then, O my Soul, rejoycingly follow that path which we ſee our Saviour trod before us? Which we ſee, though ſpread all over with Thorns, yet carried him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60846:132"/> to the Glories of Paradiſe? Shall we not confidently rely on ſo gracious a Leader; who promiſes, if we faint, to look back and relieve us?</p>

                     <p>MAY every Age ſing Praiſes to our God, and all Generations adore his Providence. From the Beginning his Mercy has ſtill laid means to raiſe us to thoſe bleſſed Objects which are above our Nature. At firſt he created <hi>Adam</hi> with all neceſſary knowledge, and then taught the Patriarchs to inform their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Afterwards he made uſe of the Angels to bring us his Commands, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inſpir'd the Prophets to declare his Will. When he had done all this, it was not enough to bring untoward Man to his true end: What did he then to ſave the periſhing World? O ſtrange Exceſs of divine Goodneſs! He ſent even his own beloved Son to dwell among us, and teach us the way of Salvation; the ſacred Art of training up our Souls for Heaven, and fitting them for the bliſsful Union with himſelf. But O! thou King of glorious Sweetneſs, whoſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60846:132"/> flowing Tongue dropt Milk and Hony! We were, alas! not happy to behold thy Perſon, nor our Ears worthy to hear thy Voice: Yet e're we were born thou hadſt us in thy thoughts, and didſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a ſufficient method to ſupply that defect; ſelecting a number of choice Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and thorowly inſtructing them in thy heavenly Doctrine; that they might keep alive the memory of thee, and witneſs to all Nations thy ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious works. Thou didſt verifie their Miſſion with the Power of Miracles, and enflame their hearts with the fire of the Holy Spirit: Over all the World they proclaim'd thy Law, and undauntedly preach'd the Crucified Saviour and God. Deep in the Breaſts of the Faithful did they write thy Goſpel, and ſeal it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes with their own Blood. Their Succeſſors depoſited the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treaſure in the common Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of the Church. The Church has been maintain'd by the mighty power of God, ſo that the Gates of Hell have not prevail'd againſt her. Thus is the Catholick Faith deſcended on us, and thus ſhall continue to the end of the World. Bleſſed be thy power, O Lord,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60846:133"/> that has wrought ſuch Miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thy Truth, and enclined our hearts to believe it. How many Souls are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſeduced by the Corruptions of the latter Ages, and revolted to a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Paganiſm with Chriſtianity! while we by thy good Providence are led in the right way to Happineſs. We are taught to direct our Homage where we cannot ſin, nor fail in doing it, to one God, by one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the Man who alſo is God. How many Nations lie miſerably involv'd in the darkneſs of Barbariſm, and Unbelief! while we enjoy a clear noon-day, and ſafely walk in the light of Truth.

                     <p>WEll, we are now ſo much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er our Grave, and all the world is older by a day than it was in the Morning of this. So much more of this ſhort life is ſpent, and can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called again. My Soul, there is ſo much leſs time left us to enjoy the good things of this life, that we have, or hope for; and ſo much leſs wherein we ſhall be expoſed to the evils that we feel or fear. Time has ſet us nearer to the Grave, from which no priviledge can exempt any of the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> The rich are nearer the time when they muſt go hence, and leave all their Wealth behind them: The great Ones of the World are nearer to their dark lodging in the duſt, into which they muſt e're long be thrown: The beauteous Face is nearer to be turn'd into noiſom rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60846:135"/> and the pamper'd Bodies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the food of Worms. This day has ſet all the living nearer to the Grave, and tumbled a great many into it. The longer we live the ſhorter does our Life become, and in the end all our Vigour, Strength, and Beauty turns to a little lump of clay. The Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked is ſo much leſs, and the time of their puniſhment is nearer approacht: The Sufferings of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent are ſo much diminiſht, and their hopes of Delivery ſo much encreaſed. They who have ſpent this day in ſin and folly, ſee all their thoughts now vaniſht like a Dream: They ſee all the pleaſure of their guilty Actions is paſt, and there is nothing remains but the juſt fears of a ſad revenge. The beſt conſequence that can be of their courſe, is the ſadneſs of a bitter Repentance. But ſuch as have wiſely beſtow'd their time, and made another new ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven; they ſee their joyes come to meet them in their way, and ſtill grow bigger as they come; till by a holy Death they join in one, and dwell together for eternal Ages.

Have we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted our cuſtomary faults, and checkt the Vices we are moſt inclin'd to?

We ſacrifice our Youth to ſport and folly, and our manly years to Luſt and Pride. We ſpend our old Age in Craft and Avarice, and think then of beginning to live, when we apprehend we ſhall ſhortly die. Thus we lead a negligent life, and Death ſteals upon us unawares.

Moreover, my Soul, all the good that thou haſt done to thy ſelf or others, thou muſt aſcribe to his free Grace, as the only principle of it. Such humility will be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, and diſpoſe thee to receive larger Benefits from his bounty.

                        <p>OBleſſed Jeſu! who art a Prince and Saviour, whoſe kindneſs it is to give repentance and remiſſion of ſin! Beſtow, I beſeech thee, on me, ſuch a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60846:138"/> hearty Contrition for all the wandring ſteps that I have made from my Duty, as to fit me to receive thy Pardon: And then Pardon, O Meek Redeemer, what my paſſions have done, and what my weakneſs has omitted: Let a ſence that thou my God art reconcil'd to me, give me this night a ſweet repoſe as in the arms of thy tender Mercy: Make me too hereafter, O Lord, if I ſhall live after this night, more carefully watch my ſelf, that my few dayes do not ſlide unprofitably away, and eſpecially that they be not ſpent in ſin: Make me every day retire to ſtudy thee and my ſelf: My ſelf, that I may know and correct my many Infirmities; and Thee, that I may adore thy infinite Perfections. And to thy Perfections, O Lord, and the ſtrength from them communicated unto me, make me aſcribe all the good that I am able to do: Let me alwayes ſay, as I ought, This is not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me: Make me alſo the more attentively obſequious to the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy guidance of thy Grace, and grant I may never want it, while the time of my warfare and pilgrimage continues: Inſtruct me, I beſeech thee, O thou who
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60846:138"/> art the beſt of Teachers, in theſe great and wiſe truths; that the things of this world are of very little import, ſince its joys and griefs will laſt but a very little while; and that the future ſtate does infinitely concern me, where the Life and Death are for ever. Fix my heart, O Sovereign Goodneſs, I pray thee, on thy ſelf alone: Let me not be good only by halves, ſince there is a glorious Heaven prepared, that is worth all our labours: Prevent by the power and prevalence of thy grace in me, my mingling ſo much as formerly thy pure Grace with my corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Deliver me, O Lord, from the Temptations of this world, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſave me from the wrath to come; that dreadful wrath which we ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, and which many condemned wretches do already irrecoverably feel.</p>

                     <p>HE who made the Sun to enlighten our ſteps in the Pilgrimage of this ſhort Life; has he ordain'd no guide to conduct our Souls in the difficult way to our eternal home? Yes, he ſent his Son a bright light into the world, by whoſe Directions we may find our Happineſs. He who feeds the Ravens, when they call upon him, has he not provided Bread for his Children? He has; and ſtill his Mercy furniſhes means to perform whatever his Juſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The Son of God himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came incarnate, and took the humane nature into a Perſonal Union. Thus it was conſecrated by him to become the Inſtrument wherewith he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh our Redemption. He was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us upon the Croſs, that ſo he might become food to our Faith: And
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60846:140"/> that food he gives with the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bread and Wine to every the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meet receiver. Though he be now exalted to the right Hand of God, and his Glorified Body ſhall ſuffer Death no more: Yet the believing Soul that comes to this Supper, finds him really preſent, and does partake of his Body, and Blood. The Lord of love has eſpouſed to himſelf an Holy Church, and promis'd it his preſence to the end of the World: He has made her all Glorious within; the Saints are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of the Earth. With theſe he is preſent at the celebration of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and feeds them with his own Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Body at his Supper. O Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd by the Blood of Jeſus, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht with his Sacred Body! why melt you not away in Tears of Joy for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo regarded by the King of Heaven? What haſt thou promiſed, O Gracious and Faithful Lord! to him that receives Thee with an Humble Love? All that is contain'd in thoſe ſweet and myſtick words: He dwells in me, and I in him. O Bleſſed Words, if once my Soul can ſay, He dwells in me, and I in him. He is my Refuge in all Temptations:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60846:141"/> He is my Comfort in all Diſtreſſes: He is my Security againſt all mine Enemies: He dwells in me, and I in him. What can an infinite bounty give greater than it ſelf? and what can an empty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture receive better than the Alſufficient God? Bleſſed, O Jeſu! are they who diſcern Thee under the Veils of Bread and Wine: Bleſſed are the Souls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd by Faith and Love, to receive Thee at this Sacred Supper. Bleſſed yet more is that devout Heart, that deſires thy ſecond coming into the World; that longs to ſee thy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſelf, and to ſee thee in thy Glory. O thou Lord of Grace and Glory! our chiefeſt Joy and beſt Portion in the land of the living! what haſt thou prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thy Servants to give them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when thy bounty is ſo liberal to them here! What doſt thou reſerve in thy Kingdom; who giveſt us thy ſelf in this place of Baniſhment! How will thy open viſion tranſport our Souls, when our dark Faith yields us now ſuch delight! O my ador'd Redeemer, my Soul longs for the Happy Day, when I ſhall ſee thy Face without a Veil: When I ſhall be able to endure the beams of thy Glory ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60846:141"/> out upon me in their full bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And my weakneſs will not need, as now, to converſe with Thee with Clouds and Shadows interpos'd. My Soul, ſeek thy Saviour now, and thou ſhalt find him hereafter; receive him thus veil'd, and thou ſhalt enjoy him in his Glory. Take theſe things that he offers Thee, with a thankful Heart and humble Faith; and then they ſhall prove ſure pledges that Chriſt himſelf will be ever thine.</p>

                     <p>DOſt thou, my Soul, deſign an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Sacred Table of our Lord? Take heed then that thou put on a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60846:142"/> Wedding Garment; and come thither dreſt like a Friend of the Bridegroom: Conſider how chaſt theſe Eyes ſhould be which go to behold the Symbols of his preſence: How clean that mouth ſhould be, which preſumes to receive the Bread of Heaven: How all celeſtial that Soul ſhould be which aſpires to an Union with our Heavenly Lord. Look, look my Heart, look well into thy ſelf; and ſtrictly ſearch every corner of thy breaſt. Carefully empty thy ſelf of all that which this ſacred food will not agree with; that thou maiſt ſafely come to the Marriage Supper, and not eat and drink thine own Damnation. Empty thy ſelf of all ſelf-admiring thoughts, and take heed there be no ſecret love of Sin. Empty thy ſelf of Worldly cares, and let thy deſires ſeek only thy Saviour: Seek only now the Riches of his Grace, ſeek only the pleaſures of his Love. Let no turbulent paſſions now dwell in thee, but only ſerious thoughts and devout affections. This ſpiritual food affords no nouriſhment, but what we receive by calm Meditation. Come not with any malice againſt a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when thou ſeekeſt the favour of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60846:143"/> thy God. The God of love will not dwell with hatred, nor ſhew Mercy but to thoſe that are merciful. Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Faith that works by love, and then thou ſhalt be filled with the Celeſtial Manna. But the uncharitable Faith, as a dead thing, is utterly unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of food or nouriſhment. Draw nigh with a humble and broken Heart, to partake of the broken Body of thy Lord. Get a diſtinct knowledge of this divine inſtitution, that thou maiſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern the Lords Body. Know that Chriſt our Paſſover was crucified for us, the innocent Lamb of God made a Sacrifice for our Sins. We are invited to Feaſt upon this Sacrifice, and therein to be united to it, and have Intereſt in it. Jeſus Chriſt gives himſelf to us at this Ordinance; and expects that we ſhould give our ſelves to him. Come with a mighty love to thy loving Saviour; and a very great eſteem of an intereſt in him. If thou believe indeed, he will be precious to thee: And in ſuch thoughts as theſe will thy Soul move towards him: Thou art my only hope, O Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſu! and thy favour alone is all things to me. In Thee I ſhall poſſeſs
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60846:143"/> whatever I want, and thy fulneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds even my utmoſt deſires. In Thee I ſhall find the Providence of a Father; and the tender kindneſs of an indulgent Mother. In Thee I ſhall enjoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a King, and the rare fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a conſtant Friend. I ſhall need no other Advocate with the Father but Thee; nor want any Inſtruction, if thou wilt be my Teacher. What can I wiſh for more, if I may ſay: O Jeſu! thou art my God, and all things! In that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is ſaid for them that love thee, and know the value of thoſe precious words. O ſweet and charming words, My God, and all things! Sweet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to thoſe that taſt them: Not ſo indeed to the corrupted Palates of the World; who reliſh nothing but the food of ſenſe: Words that revive the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind; and fills it's darkeſt thoughts with light, and joy. Thus furniſht, my Soul, thou may'ſt come to this Feaſt, and ſhalt find the reception of a welcome gueſt. Though ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do remain in thee, yet go, that thoſe imperfections may be healed. He has kindly and earneſtly invited us to his Supper, who ſees, and has great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60846:144"/> on our Miſeries. He bids us come, my Soul, and will ſurely receive us, and with his bounteous fulneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our defects.

Welcome the glad day with Thankfulneſs and Praiſe, on which thou maiſt be admitted to this excellent Feaſt: And while the King ſits at his Table, it is meet thy Spikenard ſend forth the ſmell thereof; that thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe Graces he has given thee in devout Meditations: He delights in the exerciſes of theſe, and thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to delight in pleaſing him. Say then,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60846:144"/> my Soul, when the Solemnity begins, and thou art bid to draw near and take the Holy Sacrament: Alas, how poor, dull and empty am I! O Lord, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely unworthy ſo divine a Sacrament! In my beſt attire, O Lord, I am ſo ragged, that I am even aſham'd to ſee my ſelf: Well may I then with ſhame and bluſhing come into the Preſence of holy Angels, and much rather be abaſht to appear before the purer Eyes of thy Infinite Glory. What is Man, O Lord, that thou art thus mindful of him! What am I, the unworthieſt of men, that thou ſhouldſt Invite me! O this kindneſs is too much for Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, 'tis infinitely more than the mean Creature can deſerve; but 'tis a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuitable to a God to beſtow, whoſe goodneſs like himſelf is infinite. It is in Obedience, Great Lord, to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that I now preſent my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; and in a due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy faithfulneſs, I come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thy Bleſſings. When thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, my Soul, the words of Conſecration pronounced, which ſeparate the Bread and Wine from a common to a divine uſe, ſay, I believe, O Eternal Son of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60846:145"/> God, thou didſt take our Nature into a Perſonal Union with thy ſelf; Thou didſt take it in all its eſſential Parts, but free from all our ſinful Infirmities: I believe thy Soul was made an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin, and that offering was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Father; thy Sacrifice made a full Propitiation, and therefore are we permitted to eat of it: And ſeeing the Body and Blood of our Crucified Redeemer, I cannot queſtion the love of the Father to Mankind. God the Father, it appears, did ſo love the world, as that he gave his only begotten Son to dye for them. God the Son, I ſee, is willing that many ſhould be partakers in his Death, ſince he has Inſtituted this Bleſſed Sacrament, and Invites all men to it. With Angels then, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, and all the glorious hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I Praiſe and admire the Love of God the Father, and God the Son: I Praiſe and adore the ever bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for the Redemption of the World by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And I come, O Saviour, to take and eat thy Body which was broken for me; I come joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to drink that Cup which is the New Teſtament in thy Blood, which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60846:145"/> Blood thou haſt ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of many, and invited all believing Souls to partake of: I deſire, I long to partake of this my neceſſary Food; I deſire, I long to receive theſe incomparable dainties. As the Hart pants after the water-brooks, ſo thirſteth my Soul after thee, O Chriſt: I will open my mouth wide, O Lord, for thy full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can ſuffice my largeſt deſires. When, O my Soul, thou ſeeſt the Holy Bread broken, and the Conſecrated Wine apart from it, ſay: I remember thy ſufferings, O crucified Love; and that bitter paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ended in Death it ſelf. I call to mind how thy Bleſſed Body was ſcourg'd and bruiſed! How thy Sacred Head was prick't with the ſharp Thorns! How thy Hands, which had wrought many a kind Miracle, were bored through and torn with great Nails! How thy Feet, which had carryed Thee about to do good, were now by ungrateful men nail'd to the Croſs! How thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heart was pierc't by the Souldiers Spear, and at theſe wounds thy Blood, and thy Life forſook Thee. I muſt grieve, and I muſt love, O thou great Martyr of Love; when I conſider all this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60846:146"/> was undergone for me. I muſt needs deteſt my ſelf, and abhor my Sins, when I conſider thou waſt made a curſe for me. My numerous Sins increas'd thy heavy load; my Sins were ſome of the procuring cauſes of thy bitter Death. With a broken and contrite Heart, I deeply lament my paſt tranſgreſſions; and reſolve that from henceforth every Sin ſhall be very odious to me. I reſolve to ſight againſt it with all poſſible care and induſtry; and will not allow any known Sin to be quiet in me. When the Bread and Wine, my Soul, are by Chriſts Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters given to thee, ſay: Theſe, kind Lord, are thy Inſtruments of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and they make over to me the Bleſſings of the New Covenant. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dear ſigns of my Saviours preſence: Welcome ſure pledges of his love, and of my Happineſs. Open ye everlaſting doors of my Heart, and let this King of Glory enter in. Welcome, dear Lord, to my poor Soul, and ſit thou as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of my Heart. I ſhall be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under thy Dominion, and very ſafe under thy protection. My Beloved is mine, and I am his; I will live to my Love, that dyed for me. When the Bread
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60846:146"/> and Wine are given to others in thy ſight, thou muſt look upon them as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt: Thou muſt look with love upon thoſe whom he loves; and reſolve to practiſe all the kindneſs to them that thou canſt. Conclude the ſolemnity with hearty Joy and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſay: What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his Benefits; O match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs love of God to a poor Sinner! O Love beyond Degree! O Love that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Knowledge! I can never ſufficiently ſhow my ſelf grateful. Yet bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, praiſe his Holy Name. Praiſe him who graciouſly forgiveth all thy Sins, and juſtifies thee freely by his Grace. Praiſe him who healeth all thy diſeaſes. Study to make as liberal returns to thy Lord as thou canſt; for thy Lord has dealt very bountifully with Thee.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60846:147"/> to influence and turn our Hearts even as pleaſeth thee. O prepare my Heart according to thine own will to draw nigh to thee. Breath O Divine Spirit, upon my Soul, and then the grateful odours of my Grace will flow forth. O Lord, I would with all due affections comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate and receive my Saviour; and I earneſtly deſire that every Grace may renew its ſtrength. Let every Grace, O Lord, be ſo improv'd, as that I may bring forth more fruit in doing well; and may more ſteadily reſiſt the aſſaults of all temptation to evil. Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, help thou my unbelief; and fill me with all Joy and Peace in believing. Inflame my Heart with a more ardent Charity, let my love be ſtronger than Death, let me be rooted and grounded in love: Make me to mind more the things above, and deſpiſe the things below: to be more patient in adverſity, and more humble and fruitful in proſperity. To be ſtrictly juſt and honeſt in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful World; and charitable to thoſe that injure me, and ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.

O Spotleſs Lamb of God, once ſlain for us Sinners on the Croſs, have Mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; O Chriſt hear me, and be my powerful Advocate with the Heavenly Father.

If thou wilt, O Eternal Merciful God, one God in three perſons, do all theſe kind things for me, for the ſake and merits of the Redeemer, and out of thy great love to Souls; then ſince I can never have given thee praiſes enow, grant that I may ever live to praiſe Thee.</p>

                     <p>HAſt thou, my Soul, been Feaſting at the Table of the Lord? Has he given thee himſelf and his rich bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings? What thou haſt done ſignifies the renewal of that Covenant, that was made in Baptiſm between the Lord and Thee. Thou haſt in coming to this Feaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian, and declar'd a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to live, and dye ſo. Thou haſt pretended to account nothing ſo precious to thee as thy Saviour; and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord but he ſhall have dominion over thee. The Loving Jeſus muſt now have full poſſeſſion of thy Heart; and thou maiſt not be govern'd by the love of this World. Thou haſt bound thy ſelf, my Soul, to be the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, and to obſerve the whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our Saviour: To be taught by
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60846:148"/> his Precepts, and to follow his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Example. Thou muſt not then learn the fooliſh Maxims of this world, nor conform to the ſinful practices of it. But live as one redeem'd from a vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and engag'd to hate every wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked way. Thou muſt hereafter challenge no right to have thy ſelf at thine own diſpoſal: But deny thy ſelf to pleaſe thy Maſter, and take up thy Croſs when he requires it. When it would coſt thee thy Eſtate or Life to own him and profeſs his Truth, thou muſt cleave to him with full purpoſe of Heart; and forſake all things as droſs and dung for his ſake: Thou muſt endeavour to walk worthy of thy Heavenly calling; and that thy Converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel: And therefore live not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; and live Godly, Righteouſly, and Soberly in this preſent world. Do good to them that hate thee, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe thee. Forgive thoſe that injure thee, and live in Charity with all Mankind. As thou haſt opportunity, it is required that thou do good to all men, but eſpecially to thoſe of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith. The Law of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60846:149"/> requires that according to thy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, thou do cloath theſe when they are naked, and feed any of them when they are hungry; direct them when they are wandering, reſtore them when they are fallen, quicken them when they are ſlothful; fortifie them when they are tempted: Bear with their acknowledg'd infirmities, and encourage them in all their well-doing. And the Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plentifully entertain'd thee at his Table, does expect, my Soul, that thou ſhouldſt encreaſe in ſtrength. He expects that thy knowledge of Divine things ſhould be more clear, thy Faith be ſtronger to reſiſt Temptations: That thou be more patient under the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of this Life, and more ardent in thy deſires after a better. That thou be fruitful in Holy Thoughts, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words; fruitful in juſt and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds: fruitful to thy ſelf in thine own improvements, and to others in thy good example. If thou do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſtrength, it is becauſe thou art ſlothful in buſineſs: Be diligent then in thy work, and hold on thy way: ſo ſhall thy exerciſe of Grace make thee grow ſtronger, and ſtronger; for to him that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60846:149"/> hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</p>

                     <p>MY Soul, thou didſt diſſemble with God in going to his Sacred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it was not in thy intention and purpoſe to love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And if thou do not continue in that purpoſe afterwards, and endeavour to put in practice thy reſolutions, thou deſpiſeſt the obligations of his Love, and art baſely falſe to thy Covenant. Every act of ſin that thou commiteſt after thou haſt been a partaker of thy Lords Supper, is not only a neglect of thy Duty, but the breach of a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oath. Canſt thou find in thy heart to take the Cup of Salvation, and not call upon the Name of the Lord? if he delivers thee from Death and Hell, thou art highly obliged to Worſhip him, and reverence all his Inſtitutions: Wilt thou take an intereſt in Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him an intereſt in thee? Is it not a very fitting act of Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this, to offer and reſign thy ſelf to his diſpoſal? Is it not great ſhame
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60846:150"/> that thou ſhouldſt ever hereafter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any thing too much to part with, or do for his ſake, when he loved not his own Life to the Death, that he might ranſome thee from eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? Thou haſt renewed the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thy Saviour's dying Love, received new Pledges of thy intereſt in it: Theſe things ought to tye thee faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in bonds of Love to him, and ſpread the divine Love further in thy Soul; 'till all thy faculties and powers be under the command of it, and thy whole ſelf as it were chang'd into Love. Such ſhould thy Love be, as never to forget how great things his Love has done for thee; ſuch as never to think of thoſe great things without the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and hearty adorations; ſuch as to make thee much delighted to think of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of his Love, and often to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate him at his Supper; to make thee ſtudy what will pleaſe him, and ſtrive to do it in an univerſal Obedience; to make thee deſire that his Honour may be promoted in the World, and his Kingdom enlarged to all the corners of the Earth. Did our Saviour come into the World to deſtroy the works of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60846:150"/> Devil; and ſhall I help to carry on thoſe works in the world, by retaining and living in any ſin? This ſure were highly to affront the great Redeemer, and deſpiſe his kind undertaking: To ſuch there remains no other Offering for ſin, but they ought with fear to expect a terrible Judgment. Wilt thou, my Soul, entertain and cheriſh that which has pierc'd the heart of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? O with what Indignation ſhould we regard all ſin, even our moſt belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſins! when it was theſe that gave him his many Wounds; theſe brought him to the Agony in the Garden, theſe cauſed his ſecret Sufferings on the Croſs, which his Soul felt, when he ſadly cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me! All theſe things will condemn me, if I regard any Iniquity in my heart. Conſider further, my Soul, what is worthy of them who are waſht in the precious Blood of the Lamb. How very much ought they to love, to whom much has been forgiven! How ſhould they love one another, whom the Father ſo lov'd, as to give them his Son! Conſider again, how they ought to walk, who are conſign'd to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60846:151"/> immortal Bleſſedneſs! How ſhould they purifie themſelves, as God is pure, and caſt away all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! With what Contempt ſhould they look upon all the Pomp and Glory of this World, and pity thoſe that fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admire it, and never envy any the enjoyment of it! With what Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Indifferency ſhould they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and enjoy theſe things! They ſhould never be proud of any enjoyments in this world, nor be dejected with any wants. In vain was our Saviour a man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Griefs, to purchaſe for us the Glories and Joyes of Heaven, if the hopes of Glory are not worthy to delight us, and make us rejoyce evermore. Thou doſt underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thy Saviours Purchaſe, if the thoughts of Heaven do not enflame thy deſires; and account his Blood cheaply thrown away, if thou think it not worth thy endeavours. To anſwer then the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of thy Saviours Love, thou muſt earneſtly ſtrive to fit thy ſelf for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou muſt greatly deſire to be there, and cheriſh the hopes of it as thy chiefeſt Joyes and Conſolations on Earth.</p>

                     <p>I Acknowledge, O Bleſſed Son of God, and Lord of Heaven and Earth, that as I am thine by receiving my being from thee, ſo I was early devoted to thee: I was engaged in a Solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, by which I ſtand bound to do thee faithful Service. I own, O Lord, the Juſtice and Equity of being ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; I account it my Intereſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely thine. I am ſaved by being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to thee, and honour'd in admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy Service: It is the greateſt Preferment I can attain, to ſerve him who is Lord of Heaven, and Prince of the Kings of the Earth. Thy Service, O Lord, is perfect Freedom, and they have great Peace that love thy Law: There are no riches comparable to thy rewards, nor any Pleaſures ſo ſweet as thy Conſolations. I am aſham'd, O Lord, and have great reaſon to be ſo, for that I have liv'd no more ſuitable to ſuch a Devoted State: That I have preſum'd to diſpoſe of my ſelf ſo much according to the devices and deſires of of my own heart: I have often wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60846:152"/> from the ſafe and pleaſant Path of thy Commandments, and often ſtept into the dangerous uneaſie wayes of ſin; I have greatly diſparaged my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in thy ſight, and in the ſight of thy Holy Angels: O it is fit that thou, and they who have ſeen my ſins, ſhould ſee my repentance; that have ſeen me moſt baſely breaking my Covenant with my God, ſhould ſee me heartily renewing again ſo juſt a Covenant. I thank thy Love, Dear Jeſu, for 'tis by what thou haſt done for us, that our Repentance may be accepted: I thank thee, O gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Saviour, for Inſtituting thy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the Renewal and Confirmation of our Baptiſmal Covenant; that thou haſt commanded us at that to reinforce our reſolutions, and that thou art ready to confirm them by thy Grace. It is, Lord, the ſincere deſire of my Soul, never to revolt from Thee any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I believe there is no greater happineſs, than to be a firm Confederate with the faithful Jeſus: By which I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Temple to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Light and Love, the Spirit of Grace and Glory. Now Lord, that I have had a freſh ſight of thy Love,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60846:152"/> and have ſate under thy Shadow with Delight; thy bleſſed Name ſhall be deeply engraven in my heart; I will allow no affection but the Love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and all my powers, and all their motions ſhall be ſubject to that: I will ſay to all the Vanities of the world, Be gone, I have no room in my heart for you, whom I cannot love too little; I will reſerve it all for my Saviour, whom I can never love too much: I will ſay to thoſe Temptations that would draw me into ſin, ceaſe your baſe Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for I cannot willingly grieve my loving Saviour: If it be difficult to ſerve him, I will ſteadily conflict with thoſe difficulties: If it will coſt me the loſs of all worldly Conveniencies, I will gladly forſake all to adhere to him: If it expoſe my Life, I will let that goe, rather than deny my loving Lord. Now that I have receiv'd the Bleſſed Jeſus at his Supper, and thou, Lord, art come to make thy abode with me, I will ſtudy to give thee ſuch kind Entertainment, as may pleaſe thee, and keep thee with me: I will indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in my thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſet alwayes before thee what
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60846:153"/> I think will be acceptable; I will watch againſt every thing that is impure, and would be offenſive to thy holy ſight. I will often retire from the World to converſe with thee: Worldly cares and buſineſs ſhall not keep me from thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I have been praiſing thee, O Lord, in thy Houſe, and at thy Table, but I have not praiſed thee enough: And who can praiſe thee enough for what I there ſaw, for what I there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived! Oh! how low are my Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy Love! how vaſtly below it are all my words! I will try, O Lord, what my deeds can do in praiſing thee; and every part of my Life ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thy honour. Thus, Lord, I may and ought to reſolve; but my Practice depends entirely on thy Grace.</p>

                        <p>O Lord, our kind and gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer! Thou art exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Remiſſion of Sins: I beſeech thee, O Lord, as thou haſt enabled me to repent, and to confeſs the folly of my backſliding heart; do thou graciouſly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60846:153"/> give me thy pardon. Forgive me, O Lord, that I have been ſo falſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vows, and have ſo often contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted my Covenants with thee. O deal not with me as I deſerve, caſt me not away from thy preſence, take not thy Holy Spirit from me. I have been weakly ſtriving againſt my ſins, and could not ſo far conquer them as I would: And therefore, Lord, I came to thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to receive greater ſtrength againſt them. O let ſuch a vertue come from thy Death at this Remembrance of it, as may lay all my ſins utterly dead; and let the Influence of that power ſo remain, as that they may never revive; that I may never be hinder'd in my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by any ſin eaſily beſetting me; that I may ſerve and pleaſe thee in all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, heavenly-mindedneſs, integrity, in Charity, Humility and Contentedneſs, in whatever condition it ſhall pleaſe thee to place me. Enable me perfectly to overcome my Paſſions, and keep them all ſubject to the Laws of thy Love. Let thy Love which is repreſented in this Sacrament, ſo deeply affect me, that I may delight to think and to ſpeak of it, and may endeavour, as far as I can, to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60846:154"/> imitate it. Keep me mindful of my Vows, make my Endeavours ſucceſsful, and my Obedience perfect and compleat in all things. So poſſeſs me with the Love of thee my kind Redeemer, as to make me ardently deſirous of ſeeing thee face to face. Refine me at length by that holy fire, from all the droſs of my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and to ſuch a degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and purity, that I may be fit to fly away from this World, to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of thy Holineſs and Glory.</p>

                     <p>COme let us glory in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom is our Life, and Health, and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Shall we rejoyce, my Soul, to day? Shall we not rather mourn at the Funeral of our dear Redeemer? Such, O my Lord, was the Exceſs of thy Goodneſs, to derive joyes for us from thine own Sorrows. Thou forbad'ſt thy followers to weep for thee, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved'ſt to thy ſelf alone the ſhame and grief. Thou inviteſt all the World to glory in thy Croſs, and command'ſt us to delight in the memory of thy Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sing then, all you dear-bought Nations of the Earth; ſing Hymns of Glory to the holy Jeſus. Sing, every one who pretends to Felicity; ſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal praiſes to the God of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: To him who for us endur'd ſo
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60846:156"/> much ſcorn, and patiently receiv'd ſo many Injuries: To him who for us ſweat drops of Blood, and drank off the dreggs of his Father's wrath: To the Eternal Lord of Heaven and Earth, who for us was ſlain by the hands of the wicked; who for us was led away as a Sheep to the ſlaughter, and as a meek Lamb, opened not his Mouth. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O my God, did thy Compaſſion carry thee! how did thy Charity too far prevail with thee? Was it not enough to become Man for us, but thou muſt expoſe thy ſelf to all our Miſeries? Was it not enough to labour all thy life, but thou muſt ſuffer for us even the pains of Death? No, gracious Lord, thy Mercy ſtill obſerv'd ſome wants in our condition as yet unſupply'd. Thou ſaw'ſt our too much fondneſs of Life needed thy parting with it to reconcile us to Death. Thou ſaw'ſt our fear of Sufferings could no way be abated, but by freely undergoing them in thine own perſon. Thou ſaw'ſt our Souls ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtain'd with Guilt, that without thy Blood we could have no Remiſſion. O Bleſſed Jeſu! whoſe Grace alone begins and perfects all our hopes: How are we
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60846:156"/> bound to praiſe thy Love! how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to adore thy goodneſs! At any rate thou would'ſt ſtill go on, to heal our weak and wounded Nature: Even at the price of thine own dear Blood, thou would'ſt accompliſh for us the purchaſe of Heaven.</p>

No leſs than the Son of God came down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us; no leſs than his own dear Life was the price he paid for us.

He patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd hunger and thirſt, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious affronts of enraged Enemies. How many times did he hazard his life, to ſuſtain with Courage the Truths of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! how many Tears did he tenderly weep in compaſſion of his blind ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Country! how many drops of Blood did he ſhed in the doleful Garden, and on the bitter Croſs! the Croſs, where, after three long hours of grief, and ſhame, and intolerable pains, he meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bow'd his fainting Head, and in an Agony of Prayer yielded up the Ghoſt.

For nothing is ſo barren but it may yield ſome fruit; had we the Art to cultivate it right, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply it to our own advantage. If we have ſpy'd ſome good Example which
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60846:160"/> our gracious God has preſented to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or quicken us; did we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately entertain the motion, and reſolve in our heart effectively to follow it? If we have fallen among vicious Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which, O! too often engages into folly; did the danger encreaſe our care, and the ſin of others breed Vertue in us? We have heard perhaps ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy news, of ſudden ſickneſſes, or unexpected Deaths: But did we fear to be ſurprized our ſelves, and provide betimes for that day of Trial? We meet with accidents enow to diſparage this World; but do we really feel it loſe credit in our Hearts? Does our eſteem of the other grow ſtrong and high; and every one faithfully tell his own Soul; 'Tis not in this poor World thou muſt expect content: It is not here you muſt hope to enjoy a perfect reſt: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy whole affairs with utmoſt skil; and which is ſeldom ſeen, let all thy deſigns ſucceed: Still thou ſhalt find ſomething to trouble thee; and even thy pleaſures will be tedious to thee: Whereſoever thou goeſt, ſtill Croſſes will follow thee; becauſe where-ever thou goeſt thou carrieſt thy ſelf? Who
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60846:161"/> then, my God, is truely happy in this World? or rather I ſhould ask, who comes the neareſt to happineſs? He that with patience reſolves to ſuffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his endeavours are not able to avoid. Happy yet more is he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to ſuffer, and glories to be like his Crucify'd Saviour. When thou art come to this, my Soul, that thy Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſeem ſweet for the love of Jeſus; think then thy ſelf ſublimely happy; for ſurely thou haſt found a Heaven upon Earth; at leaſt, the beſt Heaven that this Earth can afford; and take it as a pledge of a better to come.</p>

                     <p>MY Thoughts, run over the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you have met to day; or rather forget ſuch impertinent things. What have we ſeen, but diſtracting Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and what brought home but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Fancies? How often have we felt our Minds diſturb'd! how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten endanger'd by unhappy accidents! Sometimes we frowardly throw our ſelves down; and like ſullen Children will not ſtand. Sometimes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60846:162"/> throws us down; and like weak Children we cannot ſtand. Yet are we venturing ſtill among the ſnares; entic'd by the Appearance of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent delight. We weary out our ſelves with running after flies; which are hard to catch, and trifles when they are caught. This we purſue, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that; but nothing we meet can fill our Hearts, till we have found out Thee, O Gracious Lord! our only full, all-ſatisfying good: Till we have found out Thee not by a dark belief; but clearly, as thou art in thine own bright ſelf. Remember, O my Soul, this truth of the World we live in; which our own experience too evidently proves: The Eye is not fill'd with ſeeing it's va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, nor the Ear with hearing all its harmony. Remember alſo this Truth of the World we hope for; which is made ſure to our Faith by the Word of Chriſt: The Eye has not ſeen ſuch beauteous glories, nor has the Ear ever heard ſuch raviſhing charms; nor can the Heart it ſelf conceive ſuch incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joyes, as our God has provided for them that love him: As our Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus has purchas'd for his Servants; and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60846:163"/> even for Thee, my Soul, if thou art one of them. Then thou may'ſt in Peace lay down thy Head, and reſt ſecure in the protection of thy God: Whoſe Mercy has ſo graciouſly ſingled thee out from among the race of guilty Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: To give thee the Peace which paſſes all underſtanding, and the hopes that are ſtrongly eſtabliſht on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                        <p>O Infinitely mild, and unexhauſtible ſource of Mercy and Compaſſion! have Mercy upon me poor miſerable Sinner. Have Mercy Lord, and help me, for I ſpend my daies in Vanity though I am continually haſting down to the Grave. I do not improve as I might in Vertue by the occaſions I meet with, but they often make me guilty and improve in Vice. O Lord, enter not into Judgment with thy poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for in thy ſight ſhall no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be juſtified. Lord make me judge my ſelf, leſt I be condemn'd by Thee; and frequently chaſtiſe my ſelf, leſt I be puniſht by thee: Make me mortifie my
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60846:163"/> ſenſes with diſcreet auſterities, that I may reduce my Body into Subjection to my Mind; and bring my Mind at length into a due Subjection to thee. O Lord, of thy great Mercy pardon my daily Sins; and let thy Grace make even them occaſions of improvement in Vertue. Let thy Provident Mercy, O God, make every day a new Branch of Knowledge to me, from whence the Evening may gather freſh variety of Fruits to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh my Soul to an Eternal Life; fruits that may ſtrengthen me againſt thoſe occaſions by which I have been moſt frequently overcome; that may render me ſteady in the wayes of Vertue. Grant, I beſeech Thee, that no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Good or Evil which this day has afforded, may be loſt upon me. Make me more skilful by all, to diſcern the true value and uſe of the preſent ſtate in all its various poſtures: wean me more from this world, ſince thou haſt made me for a better: Make me more ready to offer up with our Saviour my whole Concerns and Being here to thy will, and the ſole advance of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I may at length be Crown'd with bliſs among the reſt of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,

O Seal up our Eyes to the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this World, and open them upwards to thy ſolid Joyes; there let them fix their pleaſed ſight, and look 'till we be transformed into thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous likeneſs: That when our preſent earthly Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, and this Houſe of Clay ſhall fall down into the duſt, we may aſcend to thee,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60846:169"/> and dwell above in that Building not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. O Jeſu! thou didſt expire on the Croſs, and deſcend into the Grave, to deſtroy the life of Sin in us, and the fears of Death: Grant then, I beſeech thee, that theſe may never revive in me, to tempt or affright me from the wayes of Holineſs. Fix in me, O Lord, the firm belief of this very ſure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truth, That the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which our Salvation can coſt us here, are but momentary, and ſhall work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory: Through thy abundant Merits, O dear Redeemer.</p>

                     <p>TOO often are we troubled about many things, when the truely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is only one.

Do they project their Manſion Seat in a Country through which they only paſs as Travellers? No more, my Soul, ſhould we build our beſt hopes on the ſandy Foundation of this periſhable Earth; where, ſure we are, that we cannot ſtay long, and are not ſure we may have leave to ſtay but a very little while.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60846:170"/> We muſt then uſe this tranſitory Life, as Pilgrims returning to their beloved Home; that we may take only what our Journey requires, and not think of ſettling in a forreign Countrey; but wiſely forecaſt our Treaſures ſo, as to be happy there where we muſt alwayes be: Let us uſe this World as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, for the faſhion of this World paſſes away: Uſe it ſo as to gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the next, in reward for our uſing this well: So ſhall this ſhort Time end in a happy Eternity.</p>

Many, alas, take pains enough; many perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much.

See how the hardy Souldiers follow their Prince, through a thouſand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to meet with dangers: See how the venturous Mariners expoſe their lives, over ſtormy Seas, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

Half theſe pains would make us excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Saints; half theſe Sufferings would place us in thy account among the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; were they devoutly undertaken for thee, and the higher enjoyment of thy Glorious Promiſes.

Thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt us but wiſely love our ſelves; and attend above all things our own true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60846:176"/> Triumphant gladly adore our God that Redeem'd us. Come now, and hear, you that fear our Lord, and I will tell you what he has done for my Soul: Hear, and I will tell you what he has done for yours, and the wonders of his bounty towards all the World. When we lay aſleep in the ſhades of nothing, his mighty hand awak'd us into Being: Not that of Stones, or Plants, or Beaſts, o're which he has made us abſolute Lords; but an accompliſht Body he has given us, and an immortal Spirit, and has made us little inferiour to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels: He printed on our Souls his own ſimilitude, and promiſed to our Obedience, that we ſhould partake of his own felicity: He endu'd us with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to live well and happily, and furniſht us with means to ſatisfie thoſe Appetites; Creating a World furniſh'd with excellent Creatures to ſerve us while we abode on Earth, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Heaven of Bliſs to glorifie us when we remov'd hence. Thus didſt thou favour us, O Infinite Goodneſs! But we, what return did we make thee? Bluſh, O my Soul, for ſhame at ſo ſtrange a weakneſs, and weep for grief
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60846:176"/> at ſo extream an Ingratitude. We child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly preferr'd a trivial Apple, before the Law of our God, and the ſafety of our own Lives: We fondly embrac'd a little needleſs Satisfaction before the Pleaſures of Paradiſe, and the eternal Joyes of Heaven. Behold the unhappy ſource of all our Miſeries, which ſtill encreas'd its ſtreams as they went farther on; 'Till they exacted at laſt a deluge of Juſtice to drown their deluge of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: And here, alas, had been an end of Man, a ſad and fatal end of the whole World; had not our wiſe Creator fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the danger, and in time prevented the extremity of the ruine; reſerving for himſelf a few choice Plants, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Earth with more hopeful Fruit: Yet they quickly grew wild, and brought forth ſour Grapes, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens teeth were ſet on edge. Quickly they aſpir'd to an intollerable Pride of fortifying their wickedneſs againſt the power of Heaven: Juſtice was now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to a ſecond deluge, and to bring again a Cloud over the Earth; but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy diſcover'd a bow in the Cloud, and our faithful God remembred his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; allaying their Puniſhment with a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60846:177"/> milder Sentence, and only ſcattering them from the place of their Conſpiracy; which yet his Providence turn'd into a Bleſſing, by making it an occaſion of Peopling the World. Still their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Nature diſobey'd again, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear'd his Judgments, nor valued his Mercies; but with a graceleſs emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they propagated ſin, as far as his Goodneſs propagated Mankind: Then he ſelected a private Family, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd and govern'd them with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tenderneſs; giving them a Law by the hands of Angels, and engaging their Obedience by a thouſand favours: But they neglected too their God and Heaven, and fell in love with the wayes of Death. When thou hadſt thus, O deareſt Lord! uſed many Remedies, and our Diſeaſe was beyond their power to cure; when the light of Nature proved too weak a guide, and the general Flood too mild a correction; when the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſoften their Hearts, nor the Law of Angels bring any to perfection; when all was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to this deſperate State, and no imaginable hope was left to recover us: Behold the Eternal Wiſdom finds a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60846:177"/> ſtrange Expedient, the laſt and higheſt Inſtance of Almighty Love: Himſelf he reſolves to cloath with our Fleſh, and come down among us, and dye to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us. Wonder, O my Soul! at the Mercies of our Lord; how infinitely do they tranſcend even the utmoſt that we could have wiſhed! Wonder at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Providence of his Councels, that they are ſo exactly fitted to their great deſign! Had our Saviour been leſs than God, we could never have believed the ſublime Myſteries of his Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Had he been other than Man, we muſt needs have wanted the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive of his holy Example: Had he been only God, he could never have ſuffer'd the leaſt of thoſe Afflictions which he ſo gloriouſly overcame: Had he been meerly Man, he could never have overcome thoſe Infinite Afflictions which he ſo patiently endur'd. In thee, O bleſſed Saviour! the two Natures of God and Man were ſo myſteriouſly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without either change or confuſion, that they made in thee but one Perſon, one Mediator and Lord.</p>

                        <p>SOon as this Bleſt Decree was made, of ſending the Son of God to redeem Mankind: Immediately his goodneſs was ready to come among us, had our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious world been ready to receive him. But as yet we were too groſs and ſenſual,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60846:179"/> and utterly uncapable of his ſo ſublime Laws: We were immerſt in worldly cares and pleaſures, and indiſpoſed to be allur'd by unſeen rewards. While we were thus unfit for thee, O God of pure and perfect holineſs! Thou graciouſly wert pleaſed to ſtay for us; and all that time to prepare us for thy coming: From the beginning entertaining us with Hope; and through every age confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Faith. How early, O my God, didſt thou engage to relieve us! The <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> ſhall <hi>break</hi> the Serpents <hi>head.</hi> How often didſt thou repeat thy Promiſe to <hi>Abraham! In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> How many wayes did thy mercy invent, by unqueſtionable tokens to give notice of thy coming? <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name,</hi> God with us. <hi>There ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots. The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him; the Spirit of Wiſdom, and underſtanding; the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of the Knowledge, and Fear of the Lord. I will raiſe them up a Prophet like unto Moſes; and will put my words in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60846:179"/> unto them all that I command him. And thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth that is to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Iſrael; whoſe goings forth have been from of old,</hi> even <hi>from the dayes of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> Hark how the Eternal Father intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces his Son! commanding firſt <hi>all the Angels of God to worſhip him! Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee; I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> It is too little that thou raiſe up the Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and convert only the dregs of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Thou art appointed <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> as well as to be <hi>the glory of thy people Iſrael.</hi> Hark how the ancient Prophets rejoyce in the Meſſias; and in ſoft and gentle words foretell his ſweetneſs. <hi>He ſhall come down like rain upon the mown graſs, as ſhowers that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earth. He ſhall feed his flock like a tender Shepherd; and gently lead thoſe that are with young: He ſhall gather his lambs with his arms; and carry the weak in his boſome. The bruiſed Reed he ſhall not break, nor quench the ſmoaking flax. In his
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60846:180"/> dayes ſhall the righteous flouriſh; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace ſo long as the Moon endureth. Then ſhall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be made to hear Then ſhall the lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> Thus did thy holy Servants propheſie of thee: Thus did their Children ſing thy praiſes. Bleſſed be the Lord our God who alone does wonderful things; and bleſſed be the Name of his Majeſty for ever. <hi>His dominion ſhall reach from ſea to ſea; and from the river to the ends of the earth. They who dwell in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſhall bow before him; and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall lick the duſt. The Kings of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh and the Iſles ſhall offer him Preſents; the Kings of Sheba and Seba ſhall bring their gifts: Yea all the Kings of the earth ſhall fall down before him; and all nations ſhall do him ſervice. For he ſhall deliver the poor when he crieth; the poor alſo and him that hath no helper. He ſhall ſpare the poor and needy, and preſerve the ſouls of the poor. He ſhall redeem their ſoul from deceit and violence; and precious ſhall their blood be in his ſight. He ſhall live, and to him ſhall be given of the Gold of Sheba; Prayer alſo ſhall be made for bim continually, and daily ſhall he be praiſed.</hi>

                        <p>IT was not thy Joyes alone, O deareſt Lord! that thou inſpir'dſt thy holy Prophets to foretell: But thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to them alſo thy Sorrowes, and give command to publiſh them with exact care. That they ſhould not only ſpeak thy words, but the more to affect us, ſometimes put on thy Perſon. O let our eyes run down with water; and our hearts faint away with grief: While we remember the Sufferings of our Lord, and liſten to his ſad complaints. <hi>I gave my back to thoſe that ſcourged me; and my cheeks to thoſe that plucked off the hair. I turned not away my face from ſhame and ſpitting. My enemies ſpeak evil againſt me;</hi> they ſay, <hi>When ſhall he die, and his name periſh? Yea, my familiar Friend, who did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel againſt me. As for me, thou uphold'ſt me, Lord, in my integrity, and ſetteſt me before thy face for ever. They compaſſed me about with words of hatred, and fought againſt me without a cauſe. They have rewarded me evil for good,</hi> and with <hi>hatred</hi> they requited <hi>my love. I am poured forth like water; I am
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60846:181"/> taken away as a ſhadow when it declineth. My heart</hi> within me <hi>is as melted wax;</hi> and <hi>all my bones are out of joint. My ſtrength is dried up like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. I looked for ſome to take pity, but there was none. I looked for Comforters, but I found not one. O my God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me! Thou haſt brought me into the duſt of Death. Our Fathers cried to thee, and were delivered; they truſted in thee, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the people. All they that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn; they ſhoot out the lip, and ſhake the head,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He truſted on the Lord, that he would ſave him; let him deliver him ſeeing he delighted in him. Be not thou far from me, O Lord, my ſtrength! for trouble is nigh, and there is none to help me. The Aſſembly of the wicked have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones; they look and ſtare upon me. They part my garments among them, and on my veſture they caſt lots. They gave me gall for my meat, and vinegar when I was thirſty to drink.</hi> All theſe ſad things, O Lord, thy Prophets foretold, to prepare our Faith for ſuch
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60846:181"/> Truths. All theſe indeed they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold; but could there be found ſuch wretches as would act them? Yes, O my God, thine own ſelected Nation conſpir'd againſt thee, and after innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable affronts moſt barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd thee. This too, even this thy cruel Death, thou plainly foreſhewed'ſt, in ſaying, <hi>The Inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall look on me whom they have pierced, and mourn.</hi> But O you holy Prophets! what was the diſmal cauſe, that ſhed the blood of this ſpotleſs Lamb? <hi>He had</hi> (they quickly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) <hi>done no Iniquity, neither was guile found in his mouth. He was cut off from the land of the living: For the tranſgreſſion of the people was he ſtricken. He hath poured out his ſoul to death, and he was number'd with the Tranſgreſſors: He bore the ſins of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and made interceſſion for the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours. All we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our ſins: The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Thou wert for us, O Lord, <hi>obedient to the Death, even the curſed Death of the Croſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo has highly exalted thee, and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60846:182"/> given thee a name above every name.</hi> Live, glorious Jeſu! and reign for ever, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal King of Heaven and Earth; may all thy Bleſſed above perpetually adore thee, and all thy Servants here conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually praiſe thee.</p>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60846:187"/> all Mankind: That all may believe and love him here, and all enjoy and be happy in him hereafter. But, O my God! what do we ſee, when we look abroad into the wide World? We ſee the ſad effects, but cannot ſee the cauſe why ſo many Kingdoms lye miſerably waſte. We know, O Lord, thy wayes are in the deep Abyſs, and humbly adore thy ſecret Councels: Onely we cannot think of their lamentable condition, without pitying their miſery, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring thy mercy. Some have not yet ſo much as heard of thee, and others who have heard, have refus'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee: Some who have once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd thee, have quite fallen away; others have corrupted thy Doctrines by mixing with them their own Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Many, even of thoſe who rightly believe, abuſe their holy Faith by a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Life. Thus the far greateſt part of wretched Mankind, whom thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs created after thine own ſimilitude, whom thou haſt ſhed thy precious Blood to redeem, and to bring them to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs; ſtill fail; alas! of their true end, and die in their ſins, and everlaſtingly periſh. Where, O Lord,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60846:188"/> is thy Zeal, and the Bowels of thy Mercy? Where are thy promiſes to thy beloved Son? Haſt thou not ſaid, All Nations ſhall adore him, and all the Tribes of the Earth be bleſſed in him? Haſt thou not ſaid, thy ſelf, O glorious Jeſu! <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all men after me?</hi> Haſt thou not given thy Diſciples expreſs Commiſſion to go into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature? When wilt thou again, O infinite Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, chooſe out burning and ſhining Lights, and ſend them forth over all the World; and ſend them not alone, leſt they faint by the way, or miſcarry in the end. If thou wilt go with them thy ſelf, and guide them by thy Grace, and crown their Labours with thy powerful Bleſſing: Oh, then what mighty works would be done by them! Then ſhall the humble Vallies be rais'd up, and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Mountains be brought low. So ſhall the crooked paths be made direct, and the rough wayes ſmooth and plain: So ſhall the Glory of God be every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, and all Fleſh ſhall joyfully ſee it together; the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the bright face of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Happy the times when this

                        <p>LOrd, we are forced to admire the ſweet and natural conduct with which thy Providence governs the Children of men! Leading them on from one degree to another, 'till thou haſt brought them up to their higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Thou putteſt them to learn in the School of Virtue, and diſpoſeſt their
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60846:191"/> Capacities into ſeveral forms. In the firſt Ages, when the World was young, thou gaveſt them for their guide, the Book of Nature; there thy divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance helpt them to read ſome few plain Leſſons of their Duty to thee: They ſaw this admirable frame of Creatures, and as far as theſe could argue, they could conclude: Sure there is a God, the cauſe of all things, certainly there is a Providence that diſpoſes of all things: He muſt be very powerful that made ſo vaſt a World, and exceeding wiſe that contriv'd ſuch excellent works: He muſt be goodneſs it ſelf, that did all this for us, and we ingrateful Wretches, if we will do nothing for him. Thus far ſome few could ſay, and very few could do, with thoſe ſlender Aſſiſtances which they then enjoy'd. Afterward thou gaveſt thy People a written Rule, which train'd them up in a ſet form of Diſcipline, which grew and ſpread into a publick Religion, and which was uniformly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by a whole Nation: They had ſome weak conceit of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſome imperfect means to bring them thither: But for thoſe high ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Myſteries that ſo gloriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt

                        <p>LOok up, languiſhing World, look up and ſee how punctually thy faithful Lord performs his word! When he had finiſht here that gracious work which his goodneſs undertook for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; when he had told us what we ought to do, and what to ſuffer for the Kingdom of Heaven; when he himſelf had done more than he requir'd of us, and was about to be offer'd up for us by his Death on the Croſs; and he had wrought our Salvation ſo far, that now his abſence from Earth was more expedient for us: He firſt prepares the hearts of his Diſciples, and comforts their Sorrows with theſe ſweeteſt words; <hi>Children, I will not leave you Orphans, but will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter; even the Spirit of Truth, who ſhall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Peace I leave with you, my Peace give I to you, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid: I aſcend unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to your Father, to my God and to your God; I goe to prepare a place for you, that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60846:193"/> where I am, there may alſo</hi> my faithful and conſtant Followers be. Thus he gave them to expect that the Holy Spirit ſhould be ſent into the World upon his departure from it: That this kind Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would apply himſelf to Comfort them, by all thoſe wayes wherein comfort could be given: That this Spirit ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Preſence, not only for a time, but ſhould abide with them, never to remove to Heaven again, as he did: That he ſhould continue in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church a ſufficient Guide, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Comforter; to Teach them what is to be done, to Comfort them under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to fortifie and ſupport them in their ſpiritual Conflicts; to aſſiſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and uſe of thoſe excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which he had left among them; to take their part in the World, and convert their enemies into friends, by convincing them of ſin in not believing on Jeſus, of the righteouſneſs which it appears they may have from him, becauſe he is gone to the Father; and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come for ſinful men, ſince the ſinning Angels are judged. And after their kind Maſter had ſaid theſe and other comfortable things to them, he led them
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60846:194"/> forth together, and gave them his Bleſſing, and parting from them, went away into Heaven: So loving Mothers when the weaning time is come, withdraw from their beloved Children; but while they thus deprive their tender little ones, of their moſt dear and all-ſupplying Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they ſtill depute ſome faithful Friend to aſſiſt them; for though they leave, they do not intend to forſake them. Such, and far greater was the care of our God, as his love is far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that of tendereſt <hi>Mothers</hi> to their Infants: He ſaw it neceſſary for ſo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious a Faith to be ſhown in a clear and ſupernatural light to the firſt Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they might confidently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to others, what they knew with infallible certainty themſelves: He ſaw it neceſſary for ſo perverſe a World, to infuſe into its firſt Converters a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Charity, that with an ardent Zeal they might inſtruct their Hearers, and with a patient courage overcome their oppoſers: He ſaw it neceſſary for ſuch varieties of Nations, to furniſh the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with variety of Languages, that they might teach every one in their native Speech, and underſtand their doubts, and ſatisfie their objections.</p>

                        <p>WHEN the appointed time was come, as all the works of God go forth in their fitteſt ſeaſon; the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples having tarried at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to direction, to be endued with power from on high; when they were gather'd together into one place, and with one accord, and ſo were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently diſpos'd for the Viſits of Heaven; when they had long continued in ardent Prayer, and wrought up their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the utmoſt point of deſire, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly there was a ſound from Heaven, from whence every good and perfect gift deſcends; a vehement Wind fill'd the whole houſe, for the Grace of God is ſtrong and liberal: Behold, on the Head of each ſate a Tongue as of fire, the propereſt means to inable them for the Converſion of the World: While they were all illuminated with a pure light, and all enflam'd with a fervent heat, and to communicate both to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, they were all endued with the gift of Languages. Thus were the words of the Prophets fulfill'd, and the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60846:195"/> Promiſes of our Saviour perform'd, and the Faith of the Chriſtian Church was thus miraculouſly begun: Thus were the Meſſengers of everlaſting Peace prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they were miraculouſly baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, and were perfectly qualified for their great Commiſſion; to Preach to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this happy Goſpel, <hi>He that believes and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved: When our Lord aſcended up on high, he led captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty captive, and gave gifts to men:</hi> He did not affright the world again with the Thunders and Lightnings of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but gently infuſed the pleaſant fire of divine Love into the hearts of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: How ſhould we bleſs the Lord our God, who are Members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, to which at this time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was given the grace of Chriſt; for the Letter, the Spirit; for Shadows, Truth; and for the Spirit of Fear, the Spirit of Adoption. Bleſſed be thou, O Eternal Father! God of abundant and infinite goodneſs, for this unſpeakable kindneſs of ſending thy Spirit into our miſerable and wicked World; a Spirit ſo ſuited to our neceſſities, and able to bring many of us to glory: This,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60846:195"/> Lord, was thy free gift with reſpect to us unworthy Creatures; Mankind did not, could not deſerve it of thee, it ought therefore to be the more marvellous in our eyes. And we may juſtly wonder, not only at thy Bounty, but at thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience too herein; for Mankind had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forfeited this Mercy, and it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to his Deſerts: Thou didſt ſend thy Spirit for our good and advantage, after that the ungrateful World had abuſed and put to Death thy Son. Bleſſed be thou, O Dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer! whoſe Blood and Death pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us this incomparable gift, and whoſe powerful Interceſſion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven obtain'd it: Bleſſed be thy merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, O Jeſu, who when thou hadſt finiſht thy great work on Earth, didſt aſcend into Heaven, to draw our minds even thither after thee: Bleſſed be thy Infinite Goodneſs, who when thou hadſt taught us the words of Eternal Life, ſenteſt down the Holy Ghoſt to make us obſerve them, and raiſe up our Affections to that glorious Kingdom whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art gone before us; that where Thou our happineſs art, our hearts, as they ſhould, may alſo be. Bleſſing and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60846:196"/> Praiſe be to the Holy Spirit himſelf, who though proceeding from the Father and the Son, is equal in nature and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whoſe free goodneſs it was to give himſelf to our forlorn World: He is both the Giver and the Gift, from the great Love wherewith he loved us. Thus are we beholden to the ever bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not only for excellent and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Graces, but alſo for his Preſence, who is the cauſe and Author of all Grace: And they to whom this Spirit is given, have not only the Streams, but the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living Waters; in whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs be ſpringing up, even unto Eternal Life.</p>

                        <p>COme, my Soul, and adore our God that ſanctifies us; implore his Grace to make thee able, and then adore him: Him who from the Father and the Son eternally proceeds, and with the Father and the Son muſt be equally worſhip'd and glorified. In thy Name, O Lord, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that of the Father and the Son, we are by divine appointment Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and ſo directed to believe in thee: Thou art therefore a diſtinct Perſon in that Adorable Trinity which is the one eternal God: Thou doſt make the for the Saints with the Father; and therefore art not only the power of the Father. Thy coming, O Lord, into this World, did depend upon the departure of the Son; therefore I believe thou art diſtinct from the Son. I believe, O Lord, thou waſt manifeſtly diſtinguiſht from
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60846:198"/> the Father and the Son, when at the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of our Saviour thou didſt deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the likeneſs of a Dove; when at the ſame time there was a voice from the Father, ſaying, This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed. Thou art, O Lord, not a created Perſon, but with the Father and Son art God bleſſed for evermore. By thee was our Saviour conceived in the Womb of a Virgin, and therefore was her Birth called the Son of God. Thy dwelling in one of us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts a poor Creature into a Sacred Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; therefore we ought to adore thee as God: And I humbly adore thee as the moſt high, eternal God; as of the ſame Nature, Attributes and Operations with the Father and the Son. I adore thee, as having inſeparable from thy Nature an infinite eſſential and original Holineſs as God. And it is peculiarly and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thy Undertaking or Office to make us poor ſinners holy; therefore I adore thee under the glorious Title of Holy Spirit. It was thou, O Lord, that didſt ſpeak to the World by all the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that have been ſince the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And thus it came to paſs, that all the holy Scripture was given to us
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60846:198"/> by the inſpiration of God. Thou art the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, by an internal illumination of our Minds: Thereby thou inclineſt us to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith; and to give our aſſent to thoſe Divine Truths, which our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, corrupted natures would reject as fooliſhneſs. By thee it is, that we are renewed in all the faculties of our Souls, and our Affections and Will are made conform'd unto the will of God. Thou doſt infuſe into us the breath of Life, and bring us forth in our ſecond Birth; in which birth we become the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. By thee are all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians baptized into one Body, even the Myſtical Body of Chriſt; and it is thy Teſtimony alone that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably aſſures to any of them their Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to theſe great things, it is thy kind office to ſanctifie and ſet apart Perſons for the Duty of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Miniſtry: By whoſe Miniſtry thou doſt perfect the Saints, and build up the Body of Chriſt to the end of the World.</p>

                        <p>BLeſſed for ever be thy Name, O Holy Spirit, and bleſſed be the bounty of thy Goodneſs. When the Eternal Father by creating the World had declar'd himſelf, and his Almighty Power: When the Uncreated Word by redeeming Mankind had reveal'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his infinite Wiſdom: When now there remain'd but one ſeal more to be open'd of the Book of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: Behold a ſtrange condeſcendence to our weak nature, the Inviſible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Viſibly appears: He deſcends from Heaven in the ſhape of a Dove, and gently alights upon the Prince of Peace. Again he deſcends in the likeneſs of Fire, and miraculouſly ſits on the Heads of his Diſciples. Mingling thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one bleſt compound thoſe chief ingredients of excellent vertue: Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to allay the heat of Zeal, and Zeal to quicken the indifferency of Mildneſs: Innocence to adorn the light of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and Knowledge to direct the Simplicity of Innocence. O Bleſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Teacher! Who can inſtruct like
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60846:199"/> the Spirit of God? He needs no years to finiſh his courſe, but with a ſwift and efficacious touch conſummates all things. He entred the Soul of a young delighter in Muſick, and preſently ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified him into a compoſer of Pſalms: He took a poor Shepherd from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flock, and immediately rais'd him to the degree of a Prophet. He by one Leſſon perfected the Diſciples, and poliſht rude Fiſhermen into elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preachers: He toucht the Heart of a perſecuting <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and inſtantly chang'd him into a Glorious Apoſtle. There is none, O Lord, can reſiſt thy efficacious Grace; but it accompliſhes whatſoever thou intendeſt: And the moſt Stubborn refuſers thou makeſt to become a willing People in the day of thy Power. All this thou haſt done, O Infinite Goodneſs, and all the good that we doe, is wrought by thee. By thee is every condition ſanctified to us in this mutable World; and we are inabled through all to walk ſteadily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Eternal Reſt. By Thee our Souls are comforted on our beds of Sickneſs; and thou alone fitteſt us for the Manſions of Glory. If in the

                        <p>TEll me, you eager Lovers of this preſent World, what is it you aim at in all your pretences? You weary your Bodies with reſtleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and afflict your Minds with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual care; day and night you are ſtill perplext, ſtill buſily plotting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs your ends: Tell me what are thoſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:60846:204"/> ends you ſo long have ſought, and I will tell you what you ſoon will find; while they are many, they but diſtract your thoughts, and often engage them to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel among themſelves: One end, and one alone is the way to true and laſting Peace, and on that one muſt all the reſt depend. It is true, perhaps you will ſay, and by that rule we guide our Lives, whatever we undertake, our ultimate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is only to be happy; It is to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that we ſtrive to be great, and enrich our ſelves by defrauding others: It is to be happy that we run after Pleaſures, and covet to have in every thing our own proud will: But you, alas, miſtake your Happineſs, and fooliſhly ſeek it where 'tis not to be found. As ſilly Children think to catch the Sun, when they ſee it ſetting at ſo near a diſtance, they travail on and tire themſelves in vain, for the thing they ſeek is in another World: Juſt ſo we fooliſh Mortals commonly judge, and are juſt ſo deceived, when we think to meet with Heaven upon Earth. This World, alas! has now no Paradiſe, but all its Fruits are mixt with Weeds and Thorns; all dangerouſly mixed with oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin, all ſprinkled over with the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60846:205"/> bitterneſs of ſorrow: What did we ever paſſionately love, but ſtill in the end it made us repent? Nay, the beſt end was heartily to repent, and learn by our fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tread more ſure. It is not then here that we muſt ſeek our happineſs, and yet it is happineſs that we all muſt ſeek. Happy are thy Saints, O Lord, who wiſely choſe their end, and conſtantly purſu'd the means to attain it. Come, let us adore the King of Saints.</p>

                        <p>IF thus our Nature tends to Happineſs, there is ſure ſome Happineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our Nature. Sure the All-wiſe Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator has provided means to ſatisfie the Appetites which himſelf has made. Doubt not, my Soul, the Bounty of thy Lord, but turn all thy fear on thine unworthineſs; and yet correct that fear again, that it do not degenerate into deſpair, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the worthineſs of our kind Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Look up then, and ſee a rich
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60846:206"/> delicious Land, that flows with ſweeter Streams than Milk and Hony: Look up, and ſee a glorious City, incomparably braver than the ſplendid Courts of Kings. Behold the bleſſed Angels ſhining on their Thrones, and all the holy Saints tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing with their Hymns: Great is the Clemency of our gracious Sovereign, to pardon the offences of repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Great is the bounty of our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, to Crown with Rewards his faithful Servants. Thouſands of Saints attend in his preſence, and Millions of Angels wait on his Throne, all beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rang'd in perfect order, all joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinging the praiſes of their Creator. But look up yet higher, O my Soul, in thy Contemplations, and ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Humanity of thy dear Redeemer, that bleſſed Jeſus who died for us on the Croſs, and now invites us to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his Crown: See, and rejoyce in thoſe eternal honours which Heaven and Earth juſtly pay to their King. Look up once more, and, if thou could'ſt, look infinitely higher, and humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the unconceivable Myſtery: Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now, and adore the Sovereign Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſſentially full of his own bleſt Light;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:60846:207"/> full, and overflowing into all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſhine but as little Beams deriv'd from him. Bow low thy Head and Knees to him before whom the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims cover their Faces: Bow low a humble Heart to him, before whom all the happy Saints caſt down their Crowns. When thou haſt ſeen all this, my Soul, and ſtaid, and dwelt a while among theſe pleaſing wonders; then turn thine Eye down towards this Earth again, and ſee the petty things that are wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our minds: What is a name of Honour, and a momentary pleaſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the Bliſs of an eternal Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe? What is a bag of Money, or a fair Eſtate, if counterballanc'd with the Treaſures of Heaven? How narrow there do our greateſt Kingdoms ſeem! how ſmall a Circle the whole Globe of Earth! Cities and Towns appear like little Hills, and the buſie World but as a Swarm of Ants running up and down, and juſtling one another, and making all this ſtir for a few grains of Corn. O Heaven! let me again lift up my Eyes to thee, and take a fuller view of that glorious Proſpect: There I will ſtand, and fix my ſteady ſight, till I have lookt my ſelf into this
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60846:207"/> firm judgment: All that the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous fortune can here poſſeſs, or even the largeſt Fancy poſſibly imagine; all is an idle Dream to thoſe real Joyes, an abſolute Nothing to that ſolid Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

                        <p>IT is true; there is, I ſee, a glorious State prepar'd above for the Spirits of juſt men made perfect: But how ſhall we poor duſt and aſhes, and laden too with the burthen of our ſins! how ſhall we hope to aſcend thoſe higher Regions, or obtain a portion in that holy Land? Fear not, my Soul, but ſend up thy Sighs and Prayers to the gracious King of Saints: Seek to him, and he will guide thee by his Counſel, till he has brought thee alſo ſafe to his Glory. If thou would'ſt know what makes the bright Angels ſo happy; his Word will tell thee, that they readily obey their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: If thou would'ſt know what rais'd the bleſſed Saints to that high Felicity which they now enjoy; it will be told
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60846:208"/> thee, They faithfully lov'd their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and follow'd the Dictates of Love till it brought them thither. If thou would'ſt know what bred in thoſe happy Creatures the excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are thus rewarded; if thou could'ſt hear their acknowledgements, thou would'ſt find them often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as theſe: Bleſſed for ever be the Grace of our God, which alone has wrought all our works in us: Bleſſed for ever be the Bounty of our Lord; which firſt freely gave to us, and then as bounteouſly Crown'd thoſe his own gifts. O you bleſt Saints, who are now arriv'd at the quiet Manſions of eternal Joy: Rejoyce ye in the King of Saints, eternally rejoyce; and ſing for ever the wondrous mercies of our Lord: His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hand has wip'd away all tears from your eyes, and now you no more ſhall weep, you ſhall no more complain: Now the ſad Evening of ſorrow is over with you, and the day of eternal joy is come: Now you no longer ſhall ſigh to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd out of this dark and tedious Priſon, but ſhall dwell for ever in that glorious Light; the light which ever ſprings from the face of God. And fear
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60846:208"/> thou not, my Soul, though now thou dwelleſt below, and art yet ſighing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of Fleſh and Blood; fear not to aſcend at laſt to this place of joy, and take thy happy ſeat among thoſe joyfull Quires; ſince they once liv'd in this ſame Vale of Tears, and were ſet to ſtrive with the ſame unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſions. He that made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, can as eaſily ſtrengthen thee; he that has crown'd their victories, will as ſurely glorifie thine: Fear not; for the way is ſmoother than the Adverſary of thy Soul would make thee believe; and the time of thy Warfare perhaps is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than even thou thy ſelf art diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deſire. Take the direction of thy Saviour's Word, and the direction of the Saints Example, to know and love but thine own true Intereſt; which ſure can be thought no very hard task: And do this but whileſt you live, which you ſeldom think too long; and this being well done, you have no more to do, but to riſe and ſing, and rejoyce with them.</p>

                        <p>LOrd, what a lukewarm Life is this of ours, compar'd to the zeal and fervour of ſome of thy primitive Saints! Often and long many of them faſted to chaſtize their Bodies, and bring them under the command of Reaſon: On all their ſenſes they ſet a conſtant guard, to let nothing in that might diſturb their peace. Part of the night they would watch, when moſt of the day they had labour'd; and both night and day continually pray'd. All things about them went on in perfect meaſure, juſt fit for their pious purpoſe, and no more: Their Cloaths, their Food, their Sleep, their Recreation; all taught to ſerve the improvement of their mind; their mind,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:60846:210"/> the only aim of all their cares, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcope of all their ſeverities; that diſengag'd from the embroilments of this World, they might quietly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Felicities of the other: That they might daily grow more enamour'd of their Lord, and more enflam'd with his divine perfections; till at laſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in thoſe holy fires, they melted away with longings to enjoy him: Sharp to themſelves they were, but ſweet to others; obliging all the World with their candid Charity: Whatever any wanted they gladly ſupply'd, and gave away at once, ſometimes both fruit and tree: They ſtudied not how to raiſe their Families here, but to entail on their Poſterity the example of their Vertues. It was not their Plot to leave a fair Eſtate behind them, but to benefit the World by their uſeful Labours: To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ignorant, and confirm the weak; to comfort the ſorrowful, and protect the helpleſs innocent: This was their conſtant work, this their belov'd deſign; to promote with their utmoſt ſtrength the happineſs of all. Lord! what a little 'tis our frowardneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, compar'd to the heroick patience
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60846:211"/> of ſome former Saints! when they were revil'd, they reviled not again; when ſpitefully ſcorn'd, they meekly held their peace; when they were curſt, they bleſt their Enemies; when barbarouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, they pray'd for their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: They ſerv'd their Lord in hunger and thirſt, and all the incommodities of an impoveriſh'd life: Often they were threatned, and they ſtood the danger; often entic'd, and they repell'd the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: Priſons and Chains they willingly accepted, Tortures and Racks they chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrac'd; even Death it ſelf they undauntedly encountred, Death furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly arm'd with every ſhape of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: All this they endur'd, and a great deal more, of which unmindfull we keep no remembrance: All this they endur'd, and under all rejoyc'd, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for Jeſus. O generous Souls, you conquer'd Heaven it ſelf, and entred by force thoſe everlaſting Gates! You would not ſit down in the loweſt Forms, but ſtill preſs'd on to new degrees of perfection! and while you carefully wrought out your own Salvation, you endeavour'd the Salvation of others. Excellent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies

                        <p>LIttle, we know, O Lord, is the good we do; little the ill we ſuffer with patience: But what, alas! ſhould we have done or ſuffer'd, had not thy Grace aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted us, and given us ſuch excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; thy provident hand has helpt us, by hanging out thoſe Lamps bright as Stars to ſhine before us: But more by thine own appearing, O Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to light and warm us with thy cheriſhing beams. Our Faith had been dark, our Charity cold; and the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our hope had languiſht away. Now we are ſure the way to Heaven is paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince it has been trod by ſo many Paſſengers. And all of them men cloath'd in fleſh and blood like us; and weakned with the ſame imperfect nature: Now we are ſure the Promiſes of God are true; confirm'd by as many Witneſſes as there
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:60846:212"/> are Saints in Paradiſe: Who by their own experience are fully convinced, and with joy acknowledge that they are ſo. And by raviſhing ſweets they perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſt, are perpetually excited to adore and ſing, Faithful is our Lord in all his words, and overflowingly bounteous in all his Gifts: While we liv'd, we receiv'd the hundred fold; and now we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to an infinity of Bliſs. What he freely promis'd he has fully perform'd; what he engag'd to give us, he has abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly paid: He told us of treaſures, and golden crowns; but the joyes we find are incomparably greater; Joyes of a far more high and noble race; which neither we can expreſs, nor you below conceive. 'Tis enough for us that we feel them in our Breaſt; 'tis enough for you as yet that ye ſee them in your Faith. Even our leſſer happineſſes infinitely ſurpaſs the greateſt pleaſures of your dull world. O how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable is the Company we enjoy! how delightful the meeting of our old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance! with whom we have pray'd, and wept and ſuffer'd; with whom we ſpake of this day, and of this place: With whom we now can ſafely ſing, free from the ſcorn and malice of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:60846:212"/> Bleſſed for ever be the goodneſs of our God, that has brought us hither to his own Palace. This is not like our Cottages of clay; nor the loathſom Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons where we lay in Fetters. This chearful melody is not like our old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; nor the threatning words of our Stern Oppreſſours. The Scene is chang'd, and, for our world of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, behold we enjoy a Paradiſe of endleſs felicities. Here we ſhall live, and ever live; here we ſhall praiſe our God, and ever praiſe him. Thus ſings the Church triumphant, and thus ſhall we; if we practiſe diligently the Leſſons they have taught us. If we inure our ſelves to the ſame bleſt notes on Earth, and live in tune with our holy Songs: We ſhall hereafter be admitted to their Quires, and ſing as long, and as loud as they.</p>

                        <p>TAke courage now, my Soul, and chaſe away thy Doubts, far more are with us than againſt us. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is on our ſide, and all his hoſts of miniſtring Spirits. Our great Creator looks on to excite us; our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60846:213"/> Redeemer comes down to inſtruct us: The Bleſſed Spirit is within us, to confirm our Hearts; and the whole Trinity ready to crown our Victories: Whom ſhall we then fear, when we are thus ſafely guarded? who can reſiſt ſo invincible a ſtrength? None but our own corrupted nature dare contend, and the unlucky accidents that conſpire with it againſt us; Sometimes ſurprizing our unwary negligence; ſometimes defeating even our ſtrongeſt reſolves. Not that they can compell our wills, unleſs we yield; or make the leaſt wound without our conſent. Much leſs prevail againſt the power of Heaven; and fruſtrate the purpoſe of the Almighty Wiſdom: Whoſe Mercy has us'd more arts to ſave us, than the craft of Vice can invent to deſtroy us. Such a Redemption ſo miraculouſly wrought; ſuch holy Sacraments, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated: Such glorious promiſes ſo faithfully aſſur'd; and which revives our hope, ſo eaſily attain'd. O infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how generous is thy Love! how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally extended over all the World! Thou invites;t little Children to come to thee, and the lame, and the blind to ſit down at thy Feaſt. None are ſhut out of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:60846:213"/> Heaven, but ſuch as will not go in; none made unhappy, but thoſe who care not to be otherwiſe. Chear then thy ſelf, my Heart, and let no fears moleſt thee; nor even Death it ſelf abate thy courage. Death is a paſſage that was alwayes ſhort, and our Saviours death has made it ſafe to them that follow him in their lives: By the practice of the Saints it is grown familiar; and by their happy ſucceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſirable. Loſe not then thy hope in ſo glorious an enterprize; where Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is at ſtake, and Heaven is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. That Heaven for which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hermits ſought devout retirement in the Deſerts: That Heaven for which the holy Confeſſors ſpent all their time; and innumerable Martyrs laid down their deareſt lives: That Heaven, where Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Angels continually ſing; and all the bleſſed make one Quire: That Heaven where the adored Jeſus eternally Reigns; and the Immortal Deity ſhines bright for ever: That very Heaven is promis'd to thee, my Soul; that bleſt Eternity thou art commanded to hope for. Raiſe now thy head, and ſee thoſe beauteous Proſpects, that raviſh the Hearts of all their beholders. Yonder,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60846:214"/> far above the Stars is thy Saviours King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yonder we muſt dwell when we leave this Earth.

Praiſe our Lord, all you Nations of the Earth; Praiſe him with the Voice of Joy and of Thankſgiving; Praiſe him with the well-tun'd ſtrings of your Hearts; Praiſe him with the ſweeteſt Inſtrument, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience: Let every one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to felicity, ſing immortal Praiſes to the God of our Salvation: He is our full and all-ſufficient Redeemer, he has perfectly finiſht what he graciouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook; for all our Treſpaſſes he has made ſatisfaction, for all our forfeitures he has paid the ranſome: We by our Diſobedience were baniſht from Paradiſe, and he has received us into his own Kingdom: He has ſet up a Kingdom of Grace on Earth, to prepare us for his Kingdom of Glory: We wandred up and down in the wilderneſs of Errour, and he has guided us into the wayes of Truth: We were by nature Children of wrath, and he has mediated our Peace with his offended Father: We were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Slaves of ſin, and he has bought our Freedom with his own Blood: We were in bondage to the dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60846:218"/> and he has overcome and confin'd his Power: We were in danger of ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, and he has ſav'd us from that bottomleſs Pit: The gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were ſhut againſt us, and he went up himſelf, and opened them to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; diſſolving for ever the terrours of Death, and rendring it now but a paſſage into Life. O deareſt Lord, who mad'ſt us firſt of nothing, and reſtor'dſt us again when we had undone our ſelves! Who wouldſt at any rate redeem us from Miſery, at any rate procure our Felicity: How came we wretches to be ſo conſider'd! How came we Sinners to obtain ſuch Favour! that from thy Throne of Glory, where Seraphims ador'd thee, thou ſhould'ſt deſcend on our Earth, where Slaves would affront thee: That thou ſhould'ſt lead a Life of poverty and labour, and in perfect Innocence dye a Death of ſhame and ſorrow: That thou ſhould'ſt do all this for ſuch contemptible worms as we, without the leaſt concern or benefit to thy ſelf; only to raiſe us up from our humble duſt, and ſet us to ſhine amongſt thy glorious Angels. O infinite Goodneſs, the bounteous Authour of all our hopes! What ſhall we ſay to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60846:219"/> thy exceſſive Charity? O gracious Lord, and mighty deliverer from all our fears! What ſhall we render for thy unſpeakable Mercies? We cannot chuſe but ſearch over all we have, but we can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to return but what thou haſt given us: We will therefore uſe the gifts thou haſt beſtowed on us, according to thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and give the Praiſe to Thee of what we do well: All the Glory of our Salvation we will aſcribe to thee, and to thee alone, as the great cauſe who haſt begun, alone, as and wilt at length finiſh it: By thee we will alwayes ſay we do good, and not lean to our own underſtandings; by thee we will expect our Reward, and never rely upon our own Merits.</p>

                        <p>PRoceed, my Soul, to celebrate the Praiſes of thy Lord, go on with freſh attention to remember the Mercies of thy God; whoſe Wiſdom has contriv'd to ſave Mankind by ſo compendious a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as may be expreſt in one ſhort word: He ſaw the only cauſe of all our ruin, was our Love miſplac'd on this preſent World: He ſaw the only remedy of all our Miſery, was to fix our Love on the World to come: This therefore was his great intent, and in this concentred all his Merits; to poſſeſs us with Love, the end of Faith, and greateſt of divine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to change the byaſs of our wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60846:220"/> hearts, by eſtabliſhing among us new motives of Charity; ſuch as might ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline our Affections, and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly draw us to Love our true Good; ſuch as might gain by degrees upon all Mankind, and render Salvation eaſie and univerſal: For this he came down from his Fathers Boſom, to teach us the rules of Eternal Life; that we might firmly believe thoſe Sacred Truths, which God himſelf with his own mouth has told us: For this he Converſt ſo long on our Earth, to encourage and provoke us by his own example; that we might confidently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe unqueſtionable Virtues, which God himſelf in his own Perſon had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed: For this he endur'd ſo ſharp and many Afflictions, and became at laſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Death; that we might pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer whatever ſhould befall us, when God himſelf was ſo treated by his Creatures: For this he ſo often Preacht of the Joyes of Heaven, and ſet them before us in ſo clear a light; that ſeeing ſo rich a Prize hang at the end of our Race, we might run, and ſtrive with our utmoſt force to obtain it: For this he ordain'd all the means of Grace, and left us the Sacraments of his Body and Blood;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:60846:221"/> that he might breed and nouriſh in us the Life of Charity, and raviſh our Hearts with the ſweetneſs of his Preſence: For this he eſtabliſht a perpetual Church, and ſent the Holy Ghoſt to Inſpire and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it; that it might be maintain'd through all Ages in Truth and Sanctity, and plant the ſame heavenly Seed over all the World: For this he aſſum'd thoſe ſtrange endearing Names of Friend, and Brother, and Spouſe to us Wretches; doing far more for us, O wondrous Love! than all thoſe Names import, than all our hearts can wiſh. Bleſſed, O Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jeſu! be the Wiſdom of thy Mercy, that has found ſo ſweet and ſhort a way to ſave us: Thou art, O Lord, the cauſe of all our Love, and Love the cauſe of all our Happineſs: By Love we fulfil all thy Commands, and in keeping thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands there is great reward: By Love we are reconcil'd from Enemies to Friends; by Holy Love we are tranſlated from Death to Life; by Love we are deliver'd from the fear of Hell, by Love we are the regenerated Heirs of Heaven; by Love we are diſpos'd for that bliſsful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; by Love we are ſecur'd of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our God; who by the ſole
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60846:221"/> perfection of his own free Goodneſs can never deny himſelf to thoſe that love him; elſe would their very loving him be a cauſe of great miſery; ſince the miſery of a Soul is the want of what it loves: Indeed he that is poſſeſt with love, is ſo far already a partaker of a divine nature; for thou haſt told us, O Lord, that God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God, and God in him. He then that loves muſt needs be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably happy too, for ſo much as he has of God, ſo much he poſſeſſes of his true good. Thus, Lord Jeſus, whatever thy holy books do record of thee, in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſuited to our low capacities: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſay of thy reſtoring all things; and repairing again the ruines of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: All is exactly verified with this one line, which our thankful Hearts ſhould repeat with joy: Heaven is attain'd by Love alone, and Love alone by thee.</p>

                        <p>STill, my Soul, let us repeat a few Lines more, to the praiſe of him whoſe Mercies are no fewer than infinite. Of him whoſe pity took us by the hand,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60846:222"/> and kindly led us into his own light. Of thee, O Bleſſed Jeſu, our Lord, our God, who alone art the ſource of all our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: The World till thou cameſt ſate wrapt in darkneſs; and few diſcern'd ſo much as a ſhadow of thee: They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Appetites of Senſe and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and plac'd their felicity in being proſperous here: Little conſidering the Life to come; and leſs the joyes that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain that Life: This was, alas! their miſerable State; and which was worſe than this, they had no power to help it. How could they believe what they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of; or love what they never believed? How could they deſire what they never lov'd, or be glad to receive what they never deſir'd? It was thou, O Lord, didſt firſt teach us our true end, the bliſsful Viſion of the Eternal Deity. It was thou didſt firſt teach us the true means to attain that end; by a hearty love and deſire to attain it. O the bleſt change which thy hand has wrought! the happy improvements which thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has produc't! Now every Woman, and illiterate Man can diſcourſe famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly of the higheſt Truths. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and the fall of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60846:222"/> 
                           <hi>Adam;</hi> the Incarnation of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man: the myſtery of the Trinity, and Miracle of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the day of Judgment, and State of Eternity. All theſe we know, but it was thou, O Lord, who taught'ſt us; and by thy holy Church firſt ſpread them over the World. Now thou haſt opened our Eyes, we plainly ſee what unaſſiſted nature could never have reacht. We ſee the framing right of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions here, is both cauſe and meaſure of our Happineſs hereafter: If we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamly eſteem the goods of the future life, we ſhall find them there and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. If we love Heaven with our whole Soul, and preſs on ſtrongly with all our force, we ſhall enter its Glories with a ſtrange ſurprizing delight; and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them for ever in a perpetual exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: We ſee our Souls are made to know, and perfect themſelves by the worthieſt objects: We ſee their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is free, and unconfin'd; and nothing can fill them but that which is infinite. All other knowledges enlarge our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and breed new deſire to know ſtill more; which if unſatisfi'd, we yet are miſerable; ſince none can be happy who
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60846:223"/> want their deſire. Only the ſight of God fills us to the brim; and infinitely overflows our utmoſt capacities: It fills and overflows all the powers of our Souls, with joy and wonder and inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſweetneſs: O bleſt and glorious ſight! when will the happy day appear, and open to my Soul that beauteous proſpect! When, deareſt Lord, ſhall I fee thee face to face! when ſhall I heartily at leaſt, deſire to ſee Thee! Thou art my full and high felicity; and only and alone ſufficient for me.</p>

                           <p>O Moſt Gracious and adorable Jeſu, who ſo lovedſt this ſinful World as to die for us, we cannot think thou wilt deny us any thing that we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ask of thee according to thy will. Thoſe that believing come unto thee, thou wilt in no wiſe caſt out: Let me then obtain, I beſeech thee, theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant favours, and whatever elſe thou ſeeſt conducing to my Happineſs.

                              <pb n="421" facs="tcp:60846:223"/> Make me ſeek therefore in the firſt place the Kingdom of God, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof; to love with my whole affections the enjoyment of God, ſince nothing but love can qualifie me for that enjoyment, and nothing without that enjoyment can ever render me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. O my God, make me ardently love thee that I may eagerly deſire thee, and eagerly deſire thee that I may with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tranſport enjoy thee. Make me, O Bleſſed Jeſu, ſo meditate on thy infinite Mercies, that my whole Soul may be fill'd with the memory of thy love; that the frequent remembrance of it may diffuſe a vigorous love of thee into all my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: let the mark and badge which they all bear, be the love of Jeſus. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep of thy love, dear Lord, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming loſt Mankind, confirm my Soul in Love and Duty: fortifie me thereby againſt all Perſecution, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo effectually draw me into thine own Kingdom of Glory, by thy Holy Life and precious Death and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſurrection: Make me to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in thy obedience to the end, that I may die in thy favour, and riſe again to rejoice with thee for ever: Who

                        <p>REtire now, my Soul, from thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thoughts, that are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to entertain thy leſs ſerious hours: Retire, and call thy wandering Fancies home, and ſpeedily range them in peace and order; that thou may'ſt be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to hear thy Lord, who invites thee among the reſt, to taſte his ſweetneſs. The Prince of Love and Bounty ſayes; <hi>Come to me, all you that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt: Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek, and lowly in heart; and you ſhall find rest to your Souls: For my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> Enough,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60846:224"/> dear Lord, enough is ſaid, to draw all the World to thy holy Diſcipline. What can be offer'd ſo agreeable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, too much, alas! inclin'd to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit? What can be offer'd ſo powerfully attractive, as to make our work delightfull, and then reward it? As to propoſe an Employment, like the Muſick of Churches, devout, ſweet, and gainful to the Performers? Whither, O my God, ſhould we go, but unto thee? Thou alone haſt the words of eternal Life. Thou art our wiſe Inſtructor to know what to do, and our onely Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler to do what we know: Thou art the free Beſtower of all we have; the faithfull Promiſer of all we hope for. Thy kind Saviour, my Soul, has given thee a gracious Call; to thee has he ſent the Invitations of the Goſpel: Shall he call, and wilt thou not hear his voice, and conſtantly follow it till thou come to him? Wilt thou be ſo fooliſh, as ſtill to go aſtray like a loſt ſheep, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering up and down in thine own By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes? Wandering out of his wayes, and the wayes of Happineſs, purſuing only thine own Perdition. By ſeeking our ſelves in this World of Vanity, we
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60846:225"/> loſe both thee, O Lord, and our own Souls: By ſeeking our ſelves in thee, and in thy Love, we find both thee, and our own Happineſs. O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable are thy ſweetneſſes, O Lord, which thou haſt hid for thoſe who fear thee, which thou haſt partly reveal'd to thoſe who love thee, and keep their taſte un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted with the World. But O! what are they then to thoſe who ſee thee, and in that ſight ſee all that is neceſſary to their Happineſs; to thoſe who rejoyce perpetually before thee; and in that joy find all joyes beſide! O beauteous Truth, which known, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Love, and which well lov'd, begets Felicity. Live thou for ever in my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Memory, and be my conſtant Guide in all my wayes. Still, my Soul, let us think of the Joyes above, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value all things compar'd with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation: Still contemplate thy dear Saviour's Love, that purchaſed for thee all thoſe unutterable joyes.</p>

                        <p>MY God, when I remember thoſe Words of thine, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> When I
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60846:225"/> conſider they were the firſt thou ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt in publick, the choſen Text of the Eternal Wiſdom; I cannot think but they contain a very important Precept, and that I ought to be deeply affected with the power of the Motive. My Soul, did Chriſt begin his publick work with this Command? Apply then thoſe ſearching Words to thy ſelf, and bind them faſt upon thee. Repent, O my Soul! for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven depends upon thy Repentance. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy me, that I cannot live without ſin, but bleſſed be our God, that I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pardon by my Repentance. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe then, my Soul, that ſafe and eaſie method of cenſuring thy ſelf, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by him. Every night ſit as an impartial Judge, and lay before thee all thou canſt of the paſt day: Severely examine every thought and word, and ſtrictly ſearch every Deed and Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And ſince thou art not ſtrong enough to be perfectly innocent, at leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be humble enough to be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent: Say, Woe to the day and hour wherein I ſinn'd; woe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes and hours I have fooliſhly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:60846:226"/> Or rather, Woe to me, who abuſe my dayes and hours, allow'd by thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to work out my Salvation. Be heartily ſorry for what thou haſt done amiſs, and make firm and wary reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not to do again what will make thee ſorry: Implore for the paſt the Mercy of Heaven, and for the time to come the ſame indulgent Mercy: Ask it in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for 'tis only by his Blood that our Repentance can obtain the remiſſion of our Sins. If perhaps thou find in thy Examination, that ſome little thing has been well done; return to God all the Glory for this, and beg his Grace to continue thy good, and improve it: His is the hand that ſowes the ſeed, his is the Bleſſing that gives the Increaſe. Thus I will once in a day at leaſt look home, and ſeriouſly inquire into the ſtate of my Soul: Whate're my Malice or weakneſs may have done, I ſhould now undo it, as it were, by a hearty Contrition: Let not the Sun go down upon thy Wrath, nor upon any other unrepented Sin. O happy man that can write at the foot of his Account, <hi>Reconcil'd to my God, and in Charity with all the World.</hi> Such an
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60846:226"/> one may go to Bed with a quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and fall aſleep in peace and hope.</p>

                        <p>LOrd, e're I take my leave of this Day, which thy Church has devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the honour of thy Memory; I would repeat ſome few words more of thoſe incomparable many that thou haſt left among us: I would attentively me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate their ſubſtantial ſence, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them as Principles of my Life and Actions. Thou haſt ſaid, I remember, O divine Wiſdom, and well worthy it is to be remember'd: <hi>Lay not up for your ſelves treaſures on Earth,</hi> where moth and ruſt do corrupt, <hi>and Thieves break through, and ſteal. But lay up for your ſelves treaſures in Heaven; where neither moth nor rust do corrupt, nor Thieves break through, and ſteal: For where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo.</hi> Go now, you curious, and ſtudy what you pleaſe, for me; I'l ſtay, and liſten to my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: He will teach me high, and ſure, and uſeful Truths; he'll teach me Truths that will bring me to Happineſs. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60846:227"/> I muſt receive and keep the Truths he teaches me, and obey their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my courſe of Life. In vain am I told this Inſtruction, if I will ſtill dote on the uncertain Goods of this World; utterly in vain, if I will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the more durable and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poſſeſſions of a better: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this wiſe inſtruction I ſhall be a fool, if I ſuffer my heart to ſix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if I ſet my Affections on that which is not. All our few dayes we live here, my Soul, are full of Vanity, and our choiceſt pleaſures are ſprinkled with bitterneſs: The things here periſh in the uſing, and our tranſitory joyes vaniſh like a Dream. Beſides, conſider, there is no reaſon thy Heart ſhould ſix here, when thou thy ſelf art deſign'd for a removal: Thou art but a meer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer and Stranger on Earth, and art paſſing hence to an eternal home. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I am dead to all the years I have lived, and ſhall never live them over again: All muſt go down to the ſame dark Grave; and none can tell how ſoon he may be call'd: To day we are in health among our friends and neighbours, and to morrow Arreſted by the hand of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60846:227"/> Death: Nature may faintly ſtruggle for a time, but muſt yield at laſt, and be buried in the Earth. At laſt we muſt take our leave of neareſt Relations, and bid a long Farewell to all the World. And how ſad a thing, my Soul, will it be in that day, to have no Treaſure but what thou muſt leave, and to leave the onely Treaſure that thy heart is ſet upon. Let thy choſen Treaſure then be in Heaven, ſince where the treaſure is the heart will be alſo. Ye careleſs Worldlings, hear but this one word more, which our great Maſter has alſo ſpoken; and then I expect you will ſtay and obſerve his Inſtructions too, if any ſenſe of your eternal good can hold you: Heark, he tells us this new and glorious ſecret; We ſhall be hereafter <hi>like the Angels in Heaven.</hi> O precious word to them that reliſh it, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly digeſt it's ſtrong nouriſhment; to them that feed on it as often as their daily bread; <hi>We ſhall be hereafter like the Angels in Heaven.</hi> Thoſe that now ſet their Affections on things above, ſhall be hereafter <hi>like the Angels in Heaven.</hi> And what, O deareſt Lord, are thoſe bleſt Angels, but Spirits that know and love,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60846:228"/> and delight for ever. Such, O my ſoul, we ſhall be, if we follow now the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Saviour: We ſhall lead that ſweet life, and be, and live <hi>like the Angels in Heaven:</hi> We ſhall know all that is true, and love all that is good; and delight in that Knowledge and Love for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No ignorance ſhall darken us, nor errour deceive us, for we ſhall be <hi>like the Angels in Heaven:</hi> No Cares ſhall perplex us, nor Croſſes afflict us, for we ſhall be <hi>like the Angels in Heaven:</hi> Our joyes ſhall be full, and pure, and everlaſting; for we ſhall be <hi>like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven.</hi> Chear thee, my Soul, and bleſs thy bounteous Lord, by whom thou ſhalt be exalted to that dignity; Comfort thy ſelf, and raiſe thy hopes yet gloriouſly higher; raiſe them to the expectation of more than thou canſt conceive, for ſo much yet more is intended for thee; ſo much more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in thoſe wonderful words: <hi>We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60846:231"/> ſends his Grace to ſanctifie us, and gives ſtrength to walk that holy way. Thus every Perſon of the Sacred Trinity has freely contributed his peculiar Bleſſing, and all together, as one co-infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have graciouſly agreed to compleat our Felicity. But O Ingrateful we, was it not enough to receive of our God all we have and are? was it not enough that the Son of God ſhould come down, and live here to teach us, and dye to redeem us? was not all this enough to make us Love?

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:60846:231"/> thou not providently reſerv'd a better Bleſſing than the dew of the Clouds, and fatneſs of the Earth: better than Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Corn and Wine, or the multitude of Poſterity, or Dominion over our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Theſe were the great Rewards of the old Law, but behold far greater than theſe are here: Divine Refreſhments from the Heaven of Heavens, and the rare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fruits of the Holy Ghoſt: Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace, and Joy diffus'd in our Breaſts: Strength and undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage kindled in our Hearts: The ſtrong and ſweet Ardours of Divine Love, that make every Duty in our way delightful, and every Croſs tolerable: A thouſand ſweet Embraces of the Spouſe of Souls, a thouſand dear Pledges of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love: Theſe are the great Rewards of the Law of Grace, and are given to prepare us for the Kingdom of Glory.</p>

                        <p>HOw glorious, O Lord, is thy Grace over all the World! How admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are the influences of thy Spirit: They who through dulneſs ſo ſlowly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the often repeated Leſſons of their divine Maſter; now when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſcended upon them, did with the firſt ſwift glance ſee through all, and no myſtery could poſe, nor errour deceive them. They who through fear forſook their Lord, and fled away from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being his; now do rejoice in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for his Name, and neither Life nor Death can forbid them to confeſs him: They who knew only their Mother tongue, and that no better than as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fiſhermen; now ſpeak to every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their ſeveral language, and with
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60846:233"/> their powerful Eloquence raviſh their Hearts: They who after our Saviours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhut faſt the doors for fear of the <hi>Jews;</hi> now in the open Streets and publick Synagogues confidently proclaim the Name of Jeſus. Theſe were new bottles ſill'd with new Wine; wine that made them quite forget their former ſelves: Wine that exalted them into a generous Spirit of deſpiſing all things for the love of Jeſus. Wine that in the midſt of Racks and Priſons, made them often break forth into that ſweet extaſie; no joy like the pain of ſuffering for Jeſus, no Life like the death endur'd for his Love. O were there now ſuch tongues of fire, to kindle in the world thoſe divine flames! O were there now ſuch Hearts in the world to receive the holy ſparks that fall from Heaven! The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preach't but one Sermon, and immediately there were converted to Thee three thouſand Souls; he preach't again, and wrought but one Miracle, and five thouſand more were added to the Church: Thus every day they encreas'd in number, and which was better their number encreas'd in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They were all inebriated with the ſame heavenly Wine, and all fill'd with the ſame Heroick Spirit: They ſold all
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60846:233"/> they had, and brought the price, and laid it down at the Apoſtles feet: they liv'd in an Innocent community, and call'd nothing their own, even in their will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were all united. Every one had enough, and that is to be rich; none had too much, and that is to be free; free from the cares that perplex the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, free from the temptations that wait on ſuperfluity: Hadſt thou been there, my Soul, to have ſeen the flaming ardour of thoſe firſt converts; it would have made thee utterly aſham'd of all ſloath, and coldneſs. You may eaſily ſuppoſe, you might have heard them ſaying ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate words as theſe from a mixture of grief and love: Ah deareſt Lord, why were we not ſo happy, as to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thee, while thou livedſt amongſt us? Why not to entertain Salvation, when thou broughteſt it to our homes; and didſt preferre our little Nation before all the World? Unhappy we in our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and perverſeneſs, which were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our inſidelity: We lookt on thy many kind miracles, O Lord, and did not ſee them. Before our Eyes thou didſt give ſight to the Blind, and our Souls were dark with Sin and prejudice: Thou didſt cleanſe the Leprous, and heal
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60846:234"/> all manner of Diſeaſes; thou didſt raiſe the Dead, and caſt out Devils with a Word: Yet we alas, how many of us blaſphem'd thy Name! how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with thy Bloody Crucifiers! We cryed out among the tumultuous rabble, Away with him, away with him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, crucifie him; for we knew thee not then to be the Lord of Glory. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thy holy Spirit, who has opened our Eyes, and made us ſee through the veil that eclips'd thy luſtre: Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee the <hi>Meſſias</hi> we expected, now we acknowledge thee the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                        <p>PRoceed, my Soul, a little further to meditate on the mighty works of the Holy Spirit: and with their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs admire his power; and with their goodneſs his bounty and Love. When Lord, thou didſt deſcend into our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, then was that Word of thy faithful Prophet fulfill'd: <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid: the Calf and the Young Lion, and the Fatling ſhall be together; and even a little Child ſhall lead them.</hi> They who in the day of our Saviours Paſſion,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60846:234"/> fiercely perſecuted him like Lions and Wolves; thou didſt eaſily convert many of them into innocent Sheep, and join them with the reſt of his harmleſs Flock. Thoſe that were covetous as Wolves, thy powerful Grace made them liberal; thoſe that were fierce and proud as Lions, it made humble and meek: Thoſe that had been intemperate as Swine, were made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and they that were luſtful as Goats, became chaſt: They were all join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bonds of pure Charity, and ſubmitted to the government of the meek and poor Apoſtles: Then was the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God not a burden but a delight; not a diverſion but a buſineſs to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love thou didſt inſpire. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples continued daily in the Apoſtles Doctrine; humbly attending to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtructions: Daily they broke the holy Bread; and celebrated the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Supper of our Lord; inflaming thereby their love to him, and confirming their holy Faith, and reſolutions: Daily they aſſembled to unite their Prayers; being fill'd with the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications: Thus they obey'd thy dictates, and thus they encreas'd in the meaſure of thy Gifts and the ſtrength of thy Graces: Such were the fervours of thoſe happy
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60846:235"/> times; and, Oh how Happy were our times, had we thoſe fervours too: But our times alas, are become miſerable, by Schiſms, and hereſies, and the darkneſs that covers a great part of the World: Ours are become miſerable by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Charity; and by the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous examples of too many Chriſtians: Many are ſcandalous in the Principles which they profeſs, to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lord's inſtructions; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others in their vicious Converſations, which diſparage his wiſe and pure Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: Too many, alas! there are of theſe, yet the Gates of Hell can never prevail againſt the Power of God: Still the ſame Spirit viſits the World, and keeps alive in ſome the ſame Primitive Fire: Still there are ſome Hearts full of the Holy Ghoſt, full of the raviſhing Wine of Divine Love: Still there are ſome who renounce the World, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take up the Croſs, and follow our Lord: Still the Almighty Goodneſs is true to his Church, and keeps it one, and Holy and Univerſal: Still the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, thanks be to his unwearied goodneſs, maintains in his Church ſome burning and ſhining Lights. He that as a Wind breaths where he liſteth, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60846:235"/> is the free Diſpenſer of his own Gifts; is often found of thoſe that ſeek him not, and vouchfafes to ſtrive with them that reſiſt him. Though the ungrateful World abuſes his bleſſings, yet he has not utterly withdrawn himſelf from the ungrateful World. Yet O, ye Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> conſider what your Maker has ſaid; My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with Man. If this refining Fire does not purge you from your wickedneſs, the ſlames of his wrath will devour your World and you.</p>

What ſhall I do, O gracious Lord, to be happy here? what ſhall I do to be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? Nature already has thus far taught me, that in all I undertake I ſeek mine own good: Onely I have cauſe to fear I may miſtake that good, and ſet up

Regard the Spirit rather, who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his proteſt, and make every devout Soul ſubſcribe this Truth; I ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this World, and its vexations, and meet in every thing danger and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

                        <p>HAppy were we, O God, could we be ſtill thinking on thee, and could we raiſe our thoughts into deſires to be with thee. Happy were we, could we alwayes feel thoſe fervours, of which ſometimes thou inſpir'ſt a little ſpark. If that ſpark were kindled into a Fire, and that Fire blown up into a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Flame. But we, alas! are hot and cold by fits, and which is worſe, our cold fit is the longer. Some few half hours we ſpend in Prayer, and many whole dayes in Vanity and Idleneſs. Sometimes we beſtow a little on the poor, and often throw a great deal away on our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Sometimes we deny and mortifie our ſelves but far more often obey our ſenſual Appetites. Sometimes we follow thy Grace, and are drawn by it to do one good Work; but we are again ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60846:239"/> by our Nature to a thouſand Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and then we reſiſt and grieve the Holy Spirit. Thus we confeſs to thee, O Lord our God, who perfectly ſeeſt every corner of our hearts: Thus we confeſs to thee, not that thou maiſt know us, but that we may know our ſelves, and thou maiſt cure us: To thee, Lord, I may go on confeſſing, for many are the Graces I want, and none can give them but thy Bounty: Many are the ſins and miſeries thy poor Creature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to, and none can deliver me but thy Providence. Such an occaſion often endangers me, and ſuch a Temptation too often overcomes me: My own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are too ſtrong for me, and my ill cuſtoms prevail againſt me: Every day I reſolve to amend, and every day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I break my reſolutions: Often am I unhappily engag'd, and blindly running on in the wayes of Death; and then I need thy Grace, O Lord, to check my deſperate ſpeed, and to make me ſtay, and look before me: To ſhew me the horrid down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall into that bottomleſs Pit where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners are ſwallow'd up for ever: To ſtrike my too regardleſs Soul with fear and trembling at the dreadful ſight of ſo ſad a ruine. I need thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:60846:240"/> Grace, O Lord, to turn my eyes from the allurements of ſin to a ſafer Proſpect: To make me ſenſibly Meditate on the Peace and Pleaſure, and great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Pious Life: To make me look ſteadily on this, and well conſider it, and beſides to look through and ſee beyond it: To make me delight in the hope it enjoyes, a hope of Joyes that are unconceivable and glorious: Joyes which none, O Lord, but thou canſt give, and none but thou canſt make us capable to receive. O Lord, all our Springs are in thee, and all our Happineſs depends on thee: In thee our Sorrows have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to allay them, our Sins an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to plead againſt them: In thee our Ignorances have a guide to direct them, and all our Frailties a God to relieve them. To thee therefore we will continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves, and rely only upon thy care and conduct: To thee we will with humble confidence direct our Petitions, who promiſeſt to help the Infirmity of our Prayers; we will not doubt the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs or bounty of thy goodneſs, but hope thou wilt grant whatever thy Word gives us leave to ask: And above all things we will ſeek thy ſelf, being aſſur'd that the Holy Spirit ſhall be given to them that ask him.</p>

                           <p>O God the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, have mercy upon me, miſerable ſinner. O God of infinite compaſſion, and comforter of penitent minds, have mercy upon me ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſinner. I lament, O Lord, and beſeech thee to pardon my ſins paſt, and to prevent the repetition of my ſins and follies for the future. Cure me, O thou great Phyſician of Souls, cure me of all my ſinful diſtempers: Cure me of this aguiſh intermitting Piety; and fix it in an even conſtant Holineſs. O make me uſe Religion as my regular Diet, and not only as a ſingle Medicine in a preſſing neceſſity: So ſhall my Soul be poſſeſt of a ſound health, and diſpoſed for a long, even an everlaſting Life. Come to all thy ſervants, O bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith, and govern our Lives with thy holy Maxims; ſubdue our Senſe to the dictates of Reaſon, and perfect our Reaſon with the Myſteries of Religion. Teach us to love and fear what we ſee not now, but what we are ſure will be our Bliſs or Miſery hereafter. Shew us the narrow way which leads to Life, which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:60846:241"/> few without thee can find or follow. Guide on thy Church in the middle path of Vertue; that we never decline to any vicious extream: Let not our Faith grow wild with ſuperfluous branches; nor be ſtript into a naked fruitleſs trunk: Let not our hope ſwell up to a raſh preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor ſhrink away into a faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: Let not our Charity be cool'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a faint indifferency; nor heated into a furious Zeal: Give us, O Gracious Lord, the free Beginner and Finiſher of all good actions, give us a right Spirit to guide our intentions, that we may conſtantly aim at our true end; give us a holy Spirit to ſanctifie our affections, that what we rightly deſign, we may piouſly purſue; give us an heroick Spirit to confirm our Hearts, that what we piouſly endeavour we may couragiouſly atchieve: Grant theſe things, O Lord, for thine own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to whom all Glory is due for ever.</p>

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:60846:243"/> into one glad Song: And which of his wondrous works ſhall we make our Theam? which ſhall be the worthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Contemplation and Praiſe? Shall we admire the mighty Conquerours of this World? or any of the Great ones whom the World applands? Shall we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the men of deep or univerſal Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? or thoſe that manage all their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs with a dexterous and ſucceſsful wiſdom? Oh no, there are greater things than theſe to employ our Admiration; thoſe bleſſed Spirits who bravely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came themſelves, and that led in triumph their own Paſſions; thoſe who renounc'd the greatneſs of this World to be rid of its incumbrances, and that they might with more eaſe and ſpeed prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a better: Thoſe who learned Jeſus Chriſt ſo as to imitate him well, and were ſo wiſe as to work out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thoſe who from mean and poor on Earth, from reproacht and deſpis'd, are advanced to be bright Courtiers in the Kingdom of Heaven, and honour'd by the King of Saints. Rejoyce thou, my Soul, who feeleſt theſe miſeries here, and often complaineſt of the dangers of this Life: Rejoyce at their glad delivery from all theſe ſorrows, and heartily congratulate
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:60846:243"/> their ſecure Felicity: Rejoyce, and with thy beſt inſtructed thoughts admire the exquiſite Wiſdom of the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; who from ſuch low beginnings can raiſe ſo great effects, making every ſtep thruſt connaturally on the next. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a little Seed that is buried in the Earth, ſhoot gently out its tender leaves, and nouriſht on with the Clouds and Sun, climb up by degrees into a tall ſtalk; there it diſplayes its full blown hope, and crowns its own head with a ſilver Lilly.
